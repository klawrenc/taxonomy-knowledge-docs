## General Introduction

GEOFFREY NOWELL-SMITH

he cinema\_ wrote the documentarist Paul Rotha in the 1930s, unresolved trialized art forms which have dominated the cultural life of the twentieth century. From the humble begincon temporary art.

As an art form and as a been in existence for barely a hundred years. Primitive cinematic devices came into and began to be exploited in the 1890s, almost simultaneously in the United States, France, Germany, and Great Britain. Within twenty years the cinema had spread to all parts of the globe; it had developed sophisticated techand was on its way to becoming a major industo audiences in urban areas throughout the world, and attracting the attention of entrepreneurs , artists, scientists, and politicians. As well as for entertainment, the film medium has come to be used for purposes scientific research. Originally formed from a fusion of elements including vaudeville; popular melodrama; and the illustrated lecture, it rapidly acquired artistic distinctiveness, which it is now beginning to lose as other forms of mass communication and entertainment have emerged alongside it to threaten its hegemony being

To compress this complex history into a single volume has been, needless tosay; a daunting task Some developments have to be presented as central, while others are relegated have guided me in this work. For a start; this is a history of the cinema, not of film. It does not deal with every use of the film medium but focuses on those concurred to turn the original invention of moving the cinema, or 'the movies' The boundaries of cinema in produces and puts into circulation. They include the audience, the industry; and the people who work in it-from

stars to technicians to usherettes--and the mechanisms of regulation and control which determine which films audiences are encouraged to see and which are pressing in on it, is history in the broader sense, the world of wars and revolution, of changes in culture, demography; and life-style; of geopolitics and the global economy they

Secondly, this is history of cinema as, both in its in its subsequent development, above all popular art. It is popular art not in the old-fashioned senseof art emanating from the 'people' rather than from sense of an transmitted by mechanical means of mass diffusion and drawing its strength from an ability to large, massified public is once to raise, in an acute form, the question of cinema as art 'great unresolved equation' . Cinema is industrial almost by definition, by virtue of its use of industrial technologies for both the making and the showing of films. But it is also industrial in a stronger sense, in that, in order to reach large audiences, the successive processes of production, distribution, and exhibition have been industrially (and generally capitalistically) organized into powerful and effcient machine How the machine works (and what happens when it breaks down) is obviously of the greatest importance in understanding the cinema. But the history of the art large again

No standing the cinema, and no understanding ofthecinema is possible without recognizing that it-more than any other art, and principally because of its enormous popu-larity\_has constantly been at the mercy of forces beyond its control, while also the power to influence history in its turn. Histories of literature and music can perhaps be written (though should not be) simply as histories of authors and their works , without reference to printing and recording technologies and the industries which deploy them, or to the world in which artists and their audiences lived and live. With cinema this is impossible. Central to the project of this book is the need to put films in the context without which would not exist, let alone have meaning. having they they -

## GENERAL INTRODUCTION

cannot be told from the point of view of the machine and the people who control it Nor is industrial cinema the only sort of cinema 1 have tried to give space in this volume not only for cinema as industry but also for diverinterests, including those of film-makers who have worked outside or in conflict with the industrial machinery of cinema gent

This involves recognition that in the cinema the demands ofindustry and art are not always the same, but neither are they are not commensurate. The cinema is an industrial art form which has developed industrialized ways of producing art. This is a fact which traditional aesthetics has had great difficulty in coming to terms with, but it is a fact none the less. the other hand, there are many examples of films whose artistic status is dubious to say the least, and there are many examples of films whose artistic value is defined in opposition to the values of the industry on which they depended in order to be made. There is no simple answer to Rotha's equation. My aim throughout the book has been to maintain balance between the values expressed through the market-place and those which are not. they On

Thirdly, this is a history of world cinema. This is afact of which [am particularly proud and which is true in two senses. On the one hand the book tells the history of the cinema as a single global phenomenon, spreading rapidly across the world and controlled, to large degree, by a single of on the other hand, tells the history of many different cinemas, growingin different parts of theworld andassertoftheforcesattemptingtoexercise controlandto 'open up' 'globalscale set

Finding a way to relate the two senses of the phrase 'world cinema' , and to balance the competing claims of the global cinema institution and the many different cinemas which exist throughout the world, has been the biggest single challenge in planning and putting together this The sheer diversity of world cinema; the number of films made (many of which do not circulate outside national borders) , and the variety of cultural and political contexts in which the worlds cinemas have emerged, means that it would be foolish or arrogant; Or to attempt to encompass the entire history of cinema singlehanded This is not just senting picture of world cinema in all its complexity have been fortunate in able to call upon a team of contributors who are not only expert in their own fields but are in many cases able to bring to their subject a 'feel' for the priorities and the issues at stake which 1 as an outsider; would never be able to replicate even ifIknewas much as do, whichldo not. This has been particularly being they

cinemas rival Hollywood in scale but are known in the west only in the most partial, fragmentary; and unhis-

space to multiple perspectives is one also important to be able to bring them all together and to give a sense of the interlocking character of the many aspects of cinema in different places and at different times. At one level the cinema may be one big machine, attitudes can be taken both to the parts and to the whole\_ The points of view of audiences (and there is no such as 'the' audience), of artists (and there is no single trialists (and there is not just lustry) are often divergent. There is also the problem, familiar to all historians, of trying to balance history as it happened' and as it was seen by the participants\_with the demands of present-day priorities and forms of knowledge (including present-day ignorance). No less familiar to histhe historical machine, and here the cinema offers a particular paradox since unlike other industrial machineries itnot only depends on individuals but also creates them \_ in the form, most conspicuously, of the great film stars who are both producers of cinema and its product.

## HOW THE BOOK IS ARRANGED

An editor's chiefweapon is organization; andit is through the way the book is organized that 1 have attempted to give form to the interrelation of different perspectives as outlined above. The book is divided chronologically into three parts: the Silent Cinema, the Sound Cinema from present. In each part the book looks first at aspects of the cinema in general during the period in question; and then at cinemas in particular parts of the world. The general essays cover subjects such and elsewhere\_

As far as possible have tried to ensure that each development is covered broad international perspective; in recognition of the fact that from the earliest times the cinema has developed in remarkably similar ways throughout the industrial world. But it is also a fact film industry\_the American-has played a dominant role, from

With some regret, however, [ decided that in the area of Asian cinema (the world's largest) it was preferable to concentrate on study in depth of the most important and representative national cinemas rather than attempt an overview of every filmproducing country. The areas focused on are the three Republic of China Hong and Taiwan) and the cinemas of Japan, Indonesia, India, and Iran also soon realized that almost any way of grouping world cinemas, and especially forms of grouping based on notions like First, Second , and Third World, was highly prejudicial; the 'national or 'world cinema' sections are therefore simply roughly west to east geographical order. This sometimes means that cinemas that show political the Caucasus and Central Asia are both geographically adjacent and shared a common political system in the period 1948-90, and are covered in succession in Part IIL. But mainland China, which also shared that system (and whose cinema was shaped by similar ideological imperatives) is grouped with the other Chinese-speaking cinemas of Hong Kong and Taiwan. In all three parts of the book the journey starts in France, but in Part Iit ends the decision to start in France may be taken to imply a certain priority; the form taken by the journey thereafter emphatically does not

makers. It is also sadly the case that it is simply not possbook of this size, to do justice to all the many individuals   who the history of cinema. But the lives and careers of individual can also illuminate with particular clarity how the cinema works as a whole. In a way the story of Orson Welles, for example, who spent his career either in conflict with the studio system Or in attempts to make films outside it entirely, can tell one more about the system than any number of descriptions ofhow life was lived within it. To help provide this illumination, as well as for intrinsic interest, the text of the book is interspersed with 'insets devoted to individual film-makers~actors, directors , producers, and technicians-who have contributed in various ways to making the cinema what it has become they

Thechoiceofindividuals to feature has been inspired by a number of overlapping criteria. Some have chosen because are obviously important and well known, and no history of the cinema would be complete without some extended treatment of their careers. Examples in this categorytaken more Or less at random--include Marilyn Monroeand are less well known to western readers but whose careers have an equal claim to be featured in history of world cinema. The need for different perspectives has also dictated the inclusion of independent women film-makers (Agnès   Varda, Chantal and documentarists (Humphrey Jennings, Joris Ivens) alongside more mainexamples can be seen as illustrative Or typical of something about the cinema which more orthodox account of film history might not adequately reflect. But I have been tempted to go further; and have also chosen for 'inset" treatment one Or two individuals   whose careers can hardly be described as typical but which throw light on someofthe rich diversity and occasional oddity of cinema, and the place it occupies in the world. The result, needless to say; is that alongside the individuals who are featured there are also many on the list, but for whom disagreements and occasional disappointments, particularly where personal favourites are not among the list of those accorded to accommodate all tastes, and, more to the point, the purpose of the insets (as I hope 1 have made clear) is not to be a pantheon of 150 great names but to illuminate the cinema across the board\_ been they

## Introduction

The history of the cinema in its first thirty years is one of unprecedented expansion and growth. Beginning as a novelty in a handful ofbig cities-New York, Paris, London, the world, attracting larger and larger audiences wherever it was shown and displacing other forms of entertainwhere films were shown, culminating in the great 'picture palaces' of the 1920s which rivalled theatres and opera-houses for   opulence and splendour: Meanwhile films themselves developed from short 'attractions' , only the feature length that has dominated the world's screens up to the present being day.

Although French, German, American, and British pioneers have all been credited with the 'invention' of cinema, the British and the Germans played a relatively small role in its world-wide exploitation It was above all the French followed by the Americans, who were the most ardent exporters of the new invention; helping to implant the cinema in China, Japan, and Latin America as well as in Russia. In terms of artistic development it was the French and the Americans who took the lead, though in the years preceding the First World War Italy, Denmark, again

In the end it was the United States that was to prove largest single market for films. By protecting their own market and pursuing a vigorous export policy; the AmerEurope languished, the American cinema continued to develop;   pioneering new techniques as well as consolidating industrial control.

film-making had gravitated westwards, to Hollywood, and it was films from the new Hollywood studios that flooded World War-and have done s0 ever since\_ Faced with the Hollywood onslaught, few industries proved competitive The Italian industry; which had pioneered the feature film with lavish spectaculars like Quo vadis? (1913) and Cabiria In Scandinavia, the Swedish cinema had a brief period of glory, notably with the powerMauritz Stiller; before following Denmark into relative

Hollywood took the lead artistically as well as industhe two aspects were inseparable\_ Hollywood appealed because had betterconstructed narratives , their effects were more grandiose, and the star system added new dimension to screen Where Hollywood did not lead from own resources it bought up artists and technical innovations from Europe to ensure its continued dominance Sweden, Ernst Lubitsch and F.

The rest of the world survived partly by learning Hollywood and partly because audiences continued to exist for a product which corresponded to needs which Hollywood could not supply As well as a popular audience, there were also increasing audiences for films which were artistically more adventurous OI which engaged with issues in the outer world\_ Links were formed with the artistic avant-garde and to tendencies in the other arts Sometimes these were derivative, but in the Soviet Union the cinema was in the vanguard ofartistic development-a fact which was widely recognized in the west. By the end of the silent period, the cinema had established itself not only as an industry from

In these early years this art form was primitive, and uncertain of its future development. It also took some time before the cinema acquired its character as predominantly narrative and fictional medium. We have therefore divided the history of the first two decades of cinema into two: an early period proper (up to about 1905); and a transitional period (up to the emergence of the feature film shortly before the First World War) , during which the cinema began to acquire that character as being being quite

form of narrative spectacle which has principally defined it ever since.

The watershed came with the First World War, which definitively sealed American hegemony; at least in the and 1920s and the way the Hollywood system operated as an integrated industry; controlling all aspects of cinema from production to exhibition. The international ramifications of America's rise to dominance are considered next. By 1914 the cinema was a truly world-wide business , with films being made and shown throughout the industrialized world. But it was a business in which the levers were operated from afar; first in Paris and London, and then increasingly in New York and Hollywood, and it is impossible to understand the development of world cinema the that established industries elsewhere.

As far as European cinema was concerned, the war pro voked a crisis that was not merely economic. Not only did European exporters such as France, Britain, and Italy lose control over overseas markets, and find their own markets opened up to increasingly   powerful American competition, but the whole cultural climate changed in the aftermath of war. The triumph of Hollywood in the 1920s was triumph of the New World over the Old, marking the emergence of the canons of modern American mass culture not only in America but in countries as uncertain how to receive it. yet

Early cinema programmes were a hotch-potch of items \_ mingling actualities; comic sketches; free-standing narmated With the coming of the feature-length narrative as centrepiece of the programme; other types of film were relegated to secondary position, or forced to find alternative viewing contexts This did not in fact hinder their development; but tended rather to reinforce became a separate branch of film-making, generally practised outside the major studios, and the same was true of serials. Together with newsreels, both cartoons and serial episodes   tended to be shown as short items in pro gramme culminating in the feature, though some of Louis Feuillade's serials in France could fill a whole programme and there were occasional attempts at feature-length animation. Of the emerging out of the early cinema, however; it was really only slapstick comedy that successfully  developed in both short and feature format. made cessful ttansition to features in the early 1920s, the majority of silent comedians, including Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, built their careers in the silent period almost entirely around the short film. genres

The section The Silent Film' looks at the kinds of film, like animation, comedy, and serials, which continued to thrive alongside the dramatic feature in the 1920s, and also at the factual film or documentary, which acquired an increasing distinctiveness as the progressed , sometimes counter) to the mainstream\_ Both documentary and the avant-garde achieved occasional commercial successes (Robert Flaherty's Nanook of the North ran several months in French Germaine Dulac also attracted substantial audiences). On the whole, however;, documentary and the avantgarde were non-commercial forms, with values distinct from the mainstream and a cultural and political role that cannot be assessed in commercial terms The film avantgarde of the 1920s, especially in France (with Fernand Léger; Marcel Duchamp; and Man Ray) but also in Germany impulse was to animate documentary both in the 1920s (Dziga Vertov in the Soviet Union, Walter Ruttmann in Germany) and after. period for

countries which developed and managed to sustain distinctive national cinemas in the silent period the most important were France, Germany; and the Soviet Union. Of these, the French cinema displayed the most the economic uncertainties of the post-war period. The German cinema, by contrast, relatively insignificant in the pre-war years, exploded on to the world scene with the 'expressionist' in 1919 and throughout the Weimar succeeded in harnessing wide spectrum of artistic energies into new cinematic forms\_ Even more spectacular was the emergence of the Soviet cinema after the Revolution of 1917.The new Soviet cinema resolutely turned its back on the past; leaving the style of the pre-war Russian cinema to be perpetuated by the many émigrés who fled westwards to escape the Revolution. The section on National Cinemas gives sep arate treatment to all three elements: the pre-revolutionary the Soviet cinema; and the Russian émigrés . and period

The other countries whose cinemas merit an article of their own in this Part are: Britain, which had an interesting but relatively undistinguished history in the silent period; Italy, which had a brief moment of international fame just before the war; the Scandinavian countries, mainly Denmark and Sweden, which played a role in the development of silent cinema quite out of proportion to their small populations; and Japan, where cinema developed based on traditional theatrical and other art forms and only gradually adapted to western influence. Space is also given to the unique phenomenon ofthe trans-

national Yiddish cinema, which flourished in eastern and central Europe in the inter-war years.

For most of these articles the period covered is from the earliest upto the introductionofsynchronized sound at the end of the 1920s. For the German cinema, however; the cutoff point is the Nazi takeover in 1933. For similar reasons the story of Yiddish cinema is carried up to 1939, when it was brutally terminated by the Holocaust. In the case of Japan, only the years up to the great Kanto earthquake of 1923 are covered in this part, and the later development of silent cinema in Japan, which went on well into the 1930s, is dealt with in Part II. days

## THE EARLY YEARS

PRE-CINEMA, FILM, TELEVISION

The history of cinema did not begin with a 'big bang' No single event-whether Edison's patented invention of the Kinetoscope in 1891 to separate nebulous pre-cinema from cinema proper. Rather there is continuum which begins with early experiments and devices aimed at presenting images in sequence (from Étienne Gaspard Robertson's Phanineuses of 1892) and includes not only the emergence in the 1890s of an apparatus recognizable as cinema but also the forerunners of electronic image-making. The first experiments in transmi images by a television-type device are in fact as old as the cinema: Adriano de Paiva published his first studies on the subject in 1880, and Georges Rignoux seems to have achieved an actual transmission in 1909. Meanwhile certain 'pre-cinema techniques continued to be used in conjunction with cinema proper during the years around 1900-5 when the cinema was establishing itself as a new mass medium of entertainment and instruction, and lantern slides with move ment effects continued for time to be shown in close conjunction with film screenings . itting long

but It is none the possible to distinguish them, not only technologically and in terms of the way were gradually gives way to the film show at the beginning of distinguishes cinema is on the one hand its technological base photographic images projected in quick succession giving the illusion of continuity-and on the other hand its use prevailingly as large-scale entertainment less they public

## THE BASIC APPARATUS

Films produce their illusion of continuous movement by passing a series of discrete images in quick succession in front of a light source enabling the images to be projected

on a screen. Each image is held briefly in front of the light and then rapidly replaced with the next one. If the procedure is and smooth enough, and the images similar enough to each other; discontinuous images are then perceived as continuous and an illusion ofmovement is created. The perceptual  process involved was known about in the nineteenth century; and given the name to lie in the persistence of the image on the retina of the eye for enough to make perception of each image merge into the perception of the next one\_ This explapsychology prefers to see the question in terms of brain functions rather than of the eye alone. But the original hypothesis was sufficiently fertile to lead to a number of experiments in the 188Os and 1890s aimed at reproducing the so-called persistence of vision effect with sequential photographs. rapid long

The purposes of these experiments were various. They were both scientific and commercial, aimed at analysing movement and at reproducing it. In terms of the emerg ence of cinema the most important were those which set out to reproduce movement naturally, by taking pictures at a certain speed (a minimum of ten or twelve per second and generally higher) and showing them at the same speed. In fact   throughout the silent the respondence between camera speed and projection was ('frames') per second seems to have been the most common well into the 1920s, but practices differed considerably and it was always possible for camera speeds to be made deliberately slower or faster to produce effects of speeded-up or sloweddown motion when the film was projected. It was only with the coming of synchronized sound-tracks, which had to be played at a constant that a norm of 24 frames per second (fp.s.) became standard for both camera and projector. period speed

First of all, however; a mechanism had to be created which would enable the pictures to be exposed in the quick succession and projected the same way A roll of photographic film had to be placed in the camera and alternately held   very still while the picture was

The problem of intermittent motion, as it is called , exercised the minds of many of the pioneers of cinema, and was solved only by the introduction of a small loop in the threading of the film where it passed the gate in front of the lens (see inset).

## FILM STOCK

The moving image as a form of collective entertainment \_ what we call 'cinema'\_developed and spread in the form of photographic images printed on flexible and semitransparent celluloid base, cut into strips 35 mm. wide This M. Reichenbach for George Eastman in 1889, on the basis of inventions variously attributed to the brothers J W. and enbach himself. The basic components graphic film used since the end of the nineteenth century have remained unchangedover the years . They are: a transparent base, or support; a very fine of adhesive substrate made of gelatine; and which makes the film opaque on one side The emulsion generally consists ofa suspension of silver salts in gelatine and is attached to the base by means of the layer of adhesive substrate: The base of the great majority of 35 mm. films produced before February 1951 consists of cellulose nitrate, which is highly flammable substance. From that date onwards the nitrate has been replaced by one of cellulose acetate. which is far less flammable, or increasingly by polyester. From early times. however, various forms of cellulose diacetate (invented by Eichengrun and Becker as early as 1901) Or by coating the nitrate in non-flammable substances The first known examples of these procedures date back to 1909.Safety film became the norm for non-professional use after the First World War. layer base using

The black and white negative film used up to the mid1920s was so-called orthochromatic ultraviolet; violet, and blue light, and rather less sensitive to green and yellow. Red light did not affect the silver bromide emulsion from appearing on the screen only in the form of indisa constant control of colour values on the set. Certain colours had to be removed entirely from sets and tumes. Actresses avoided red lipstick, and interior scenes were shot against sets painted in various shades of grey. A new kind of emulsion called panchromatíc was devised for

In the early however , celluloid film was not the only material tried out in the showing ofmotion pictures. Of alternative methods the best known was the Muto scope This consisted of a cylinder to which were attached several hundred paper rectangles about 70 mm. wide These paper rectangles contained photographs which, if watched in rapid sequence through a viewer; gave the impression of continuous movement. There were even attempts to produce films on glass: the Kammatograph (1901) used a disc with diameter of 30 cm , containing some 600 photographic frames arranged in a spiral. There were experiments involving the use of translucent metal with photographic emulsion on it which could be pro a surface in relief which could be passed under the fingers of blind people; principle similar to Braille. days,

## FORMATS

The 35 mm width (or 'gauge') for cellulose was first adopted in 1892 by Thomas Edison for his Kinetoscope; viewing device which enabled one spectator at a time to watch brief segments of film The Kinetoscope was such a commercial success that subsequent machines for reproformat. This practice had the support of the Eastman Company; whose photographic film was 70 mm. wide; and therefore only had to be cut lengthwise to produce film of the required width. It is also due to the mechanical structure of the Kinetoscope that 35 mm. film has four perforations, roughly rectangular in on both sides for drawing the film through the camera and projector: Other pioneers at the of the nineteenth century used different pattern. The Lumière single circular perforation on each side But it was the Edison method which was soon the Edison company too who set the standard size and shape, end shape

Although these were to become the standards, there were many experiments with other gauges of film stock, both in the early period and later. In 1896 the Prestwich Company produced a 60 mm film strip, an example of Archive in London, and the same width (but with a different pattern of perforations) was used by Georges Demenÿ in France. The Veriscope Company in America introduced

More important than any attempts to expand the image;

In 1900 the French company Gaumont began marketing its 'Chrono de Poche' portable camera which used 15 mm. film with single perforation in the centre Two years later the Warwick Trading Company in England introduced a 17.5 mm\_ film for amateurs, designed to be used on machine called the Biokam which (like the first Lumière machines) doubled as camera, printer, and projector; this idea was taken up by Ernemann in Germany and then by Pathé in France in the 1920s. Meanwhile in 1912 Pathé had also introduced system that used 28 mm. film on a non-flammable diacetate base and had a picture area only slightly smaller than 35 mm\_

The amateur gauge par excellence, however, was 16 mm\_ on non-flammable base, devised by Eastman Kodak in as the Kodascope, this worked on the reversal principle; producing a direct positive print on the original film used in the camera\_ Kodak launched their 16 mm. film on the market in 1923,

and around the same time Pathé brought out their 'PathéBaby' , using 9.5 mm. non-flammable stock. For many years competitor with 16 mm, and it survived for time as reduced projection gauge both for amateur film-making and for the showing of films originally made on 35 mm long

There were also more exotic formats, using film divided into parallel rows which could be exposed in succession Of these only Edison's Home Kinetoscope, using 22 mm\_ film divided into three parallel rows with an image-width perforations, had any significant commercial application.

## COLOUR

As early as 1896, copies of films which had been handcoloured frame by frame with very delicate brushes were available. The results were often spectacular; as in the case of Georges Méliès's Le Royaume des fées (1903), whose images have the glow of medieval miniatures . It was very difficult, however; to ensure that the colour occupied precise area of the frame. To achieve this, Pathé in 1906 patented a mechanical method of colouring the base called Pathécolor: This method, also known as au pochoir' in French and stencil in English, allowed for the application of half a dozen different tonalities

A far was reinforce the figurative effect or dramatic impact. Basically there were three ways of this. There was tinting, which was achieved either by applying a coloured glaze to the base, or by dipping the film in a solution of coloured stock which was already coloured. Then there was toning; in which the silver in the emulsion was affecting the gelatine on the film. And finally there was mordanting, variety of toning in which the photographic emulsion doing using

was treated with a non-soluble silver salt capable of fixing an organic colouring agent. Tinting, toning, mordanting, and mechanical colouring could be combined, thus multiplying the creative possibilities of each technique A particularly fascinating variation on tinting technique is provided by the Handschiegl Process (also known as the was an elab orate system derived from the techniques of lithography

The first actual colour-sensitive emulsion was invented 1915 and shortly afterwards marketed under the trademark Kodachrome This was still only a twocolour system, but it was the first stage in series of remarkable developments. Around the same time company founded by Herbert I. Kalmus, W Burton Westcott, and Daniel Motion Picture Corporation-began experimenting with a system based on the additive synthesis of two colours; disappointed by the results thus obtained , the three changed tack in 1919 and began exploring (still with two colours only) the possibility of the principle of sub tractive synthesis first elaborated by Duclos du Hauron in 1868. This worked by combining images each of which had filtered out light of a particular colour. When the images were combined\_ the colour balance was restored. Using the subtractive principle the Technicolor team were ready within three years to present a colour film-The Toll using

The first attempts (by  Frederick Marshall Lee and Edward Raymond Turner) to realize colour films the superimposition of red, green, and blue images date back achieved commercially viable result with his Kinemacolor. In front of the camera Smith placed a semi-transparent disc divided into two sectors: red and bluegreen. The film was then projected with the same filters at speed of 32 frames per second, and the two primary in an image which showed only slight chromatic variations but produced an unde niable overall effect. Smith's invention was widely imitated and developed into three-colour systems by Gaumont in 1913 and the German Agfa Company in 1915 using

The late 1910s and early 1920s saw many other inventions in the field of colour; but by the end of the decade it was clear that Kalmus and his associates were way ahead of the field, and it was their system that was to prevail for professional film-making throughout the 1930s and Meanwhile the great majority of films during the silent period continued to be produced one Or Other of the methods of colouring the described above\_ Literally black and white films were in the minority; generally those made by smaller companies or comic shorts. using print

## SOUND

Almost all 'silent' films hadsomesortofsound accompani ment. Early film shows had lecturers who gave a commentary on the images going on the screen, explaining their content and meaning to the audience. In number of non-western countries this practice continued long beyond the early period. In Japan, where silent cinema remained the rule well into the developed the art ofthe benshi; who provided gestures and an original text to accompany the image past

Along with speech came music. This was at first impro vised on the piano, then adapted thecurrent popular repertoire, and then came to be specially commissioned. On big  occasions this music would be   performed by orchestras, choirs, and opera singers, while a small band just pianist would play in less luxurious establishments. Exhibitors who could not afford the performance of original music had two choices. The first was score, generally consisting of selections of popular tunes and classics in the public domain ('cue sheets'), which provided themes suitable to accompany different episodes more was to fall back from

It was only after the First World War that the decisive steps were taken towards the achievement of synchronized sound film The German team of Vogt, Engel, and Massolle established method of recording sound photographically by converting the sounds into light patterns on was premièred in Berlin in 1922.

on mechanical instruments, from the humble pianola to huge fairground organs powered by compressed air into which the 'score was inserted in the form of a roll of punched paper.

Music was sometimes accompanied by noise effects These were usually obtained by performers equipped with wide array of objects reproducing natural and artificial sounds\_ But the same effects could be produced by cinema in Paris.

From however; the   pioneers of the moving image had more grandiose ambitions. As early as April 1895, Edison put forward a system synchronizing also seems to have attempted the synchronization of films and discs around 1896. All such systems, however, were hampered bythe lack ofamplification to project the sound for

The alternative to synchronizing films and discs was to print the sound directly on the film. The first experiments in this direction took place at the beginning of the machine capable of recording images and sound on the same base.

In 1926 the Hollywood studio Warner Bros. presented Don Juan, with John  Barrymore, the  Vitaphone of sound synchronization. This was a soundonran at Vitaphone system was used the following year for the first 'talking' picture; The Jazz Singer with Al Jolson, and continued in for a few more years. Meanwhile a rival studio; Fox, had bought up the rights on the TriErgon and Photophone patents, using them to add sound on-film system proved far more practical than Vitaphone, and became the basis for the generalized introduction of synchronized sound in the early 1930s. using system again being

## ASPECT RATIO

The size and of the 35 mm. film frame remained virtually  unchanged throughout the silent period, at high. The spacing of the frames meant each foot of film contained 16 frames. This too has remained unaltered , and continues to be the standard today. When projected, the ratio between width and height worked out at between size was altered slightly to accommodate the sound-track; but the projection ratio remained roughly the same at approximately 4 3-until the arrival of widescreen processes in the 1950s. In the silent and early sound periods there were a few attempts to change the size and shape of the   projected   picture. The sides of the frame were occasionally masked out; to produce Henri Chrétien presented the first anamorphic system; known as Hypergonar; in which the image was 'squeezed' by the camera lens to accommodate a wider picture on the frame; and then 'unsqueezed" in the projector for presentation on wide screen This was an early forerunner of   CinemaScope and the other   anamorphic systems which came into commercial use in the 1950s Other experiments included Magnascope (1926), which used a wide-angle projector lens to fill a large screen, and devices for as 1900 Raoul Grimoin-Sanson attempted to hitch up ten 70 mm. projectors to produce 360-degree panorama completely   surrounding the spectator. More famous (though equally ephemeral) was the Polyvision system used in the celebrated 'triptych' sequence in Abel Gance's Napoléon   (1927), where   three strips of flm are simultaneously projected alongside each other to produce a single image. shape

## PROJECTION

The normal method of projection the earliest times involved placing the projector at the back of the hall and projecting the image on to the screen in a cone of light over the heads of the audience. Occasional attempts were made to devise alternative spatial arrangements. In 1909, for example; the German Messter Company experimented with showing its 'Alabastra colour complex system of mirrors on to a thin veiled screen from also possible to project on to the screen behind, but this process (known as back-projection) took up a lot of space and has rarely been used for public presentation. It came into use in the sound period as form of special effect during film-making allowing actors to perform in front of previously photographed landscape background. from from

The quality of projection was greatly affected by the type of light source used Before electric arc lights became standard, the usual method of producing light for the projector was to heat a piece of lime or a similar substance until it glowed white hot. The efficacy of this method (known as 'limelight' was very dependent on the nature and quality of the fuel used to heat the lime. The usual fuels were mixture of coal-gas and oxygen or of ether and oxygen. Acetylene was also tried, but soon abandoned as it produced weak light and gave off disagreeable smell. being

Throughout the silent years projectors, whether handcranked or electrically powered, all ran at variable speeds, enabling the operator to adjust the speed of the projector to that of the camera. For its part, camera speed varied according to a number of factors: the amount of available and the nature of the action recorded To the movements of the characters on the screen 'natural' , projectionists in the years before 1920 showed flms at various speeds, most often between 14 and 18 frames per second. (The flicker effect that these relatively slow speeds tended to produce was eliminated by the introduction early in the century of a three-bladed shutter which opened and closed three times during the showing of each frame ) The average speed of projection increased as time went on and by the end of the period it had regularly reached a norm of 24 frames per second, which became the standard for sound film. Faster and slower speeds were occasionally used for colour film experiments or in some amateur equipment. being keep

## FROM PRODUCTION TO EXHIBITION

how many films of all types were produced during the silent period, but the figure is almost certainly in the order of 150,000, of which not more than 20,000 to 25,000

With the growth of the film business , films soon came to be printed in large numbers. For Den hvide slavehandel II ('The white slave trade II' . August Blom, 1911) the Danish company Nordisk made no fewer than 260 copies for world-wide distribution. On the other hand many early American films listed in distributors' catalogues seem to have sold not more than a couple of copies, and in some cases it may be that none at all were printed, due to lack of demand. rapid

Sometimes different endings were produced to suit the tastes of the in various parts of the world. In eastern Europe for example, there was taste for the Russian OI tragic ending in preference to the 'happy end' expected by audiences in America. It was also common to issue coloured prints of a film for show in luxury theatres and cheaper black and white ones for more modest locales. Finally, censorship, both national and local, often imposed cuts or other changes in films at the timeofrelease, and many American films in particular have survived in different forms as varied censorship practices of state Or city censorship boards. from public

## DECAY

In the early years of the cinema films were looked on preserve them once mercial life. The appeal of the Polish scholar Boleslaw Matuszewski in 1898 for permanent archive of film images to be created to serve as record for future genthat the first film archives were created in a number of countries to preserve surviving films for posterity. By that time, however, many films had been irretrievably lost and The world's archives have now collected together some 30,000 prints of silent films. but the lack of resources for cataloguing them means that it is not known how many of these are duplicate prints of case of what appear to be duplicates; whether there are significant differences between versions of films with the same title. While the number of films collected continues to rise, the number of 'surviving films is still probably less than 20 per cent of those thought to have been made. they

Meanwhile, even as the number of rediscovered films

rises, a further problem is created by the perishable nature ofthenitrate base on which the vast majority ofsilent (and early sound) films were printed. For not only is cellulose nitrate highly flammable; which may in some cases lead to spontaneous combustion: it is also liable to decay and in the course of decay it destroys the emulsion which bears the image. Even in the best conservation conditions (that is to say at very low temperatures and the correct level of humidity) the nitrate base begins to decompose from the moment it is produced. course of the process the film emits various gases, and in particular nitrous anhydride; which, combined with air and with the water in the gelatine, produces nitrous and nitric acids. These acids corrode the silver salts of the emulsion thereby destroying theimage with its support, until eventually the whole film is dissolved \_ along

## RESTORATION

The decomposition of nitrate film can be slowed down\_ but not halted. For this reason film archives are engaged in struggle to prolong its life image can be transferred to a different support. Unfortunately the cellulose acetate base on to which the transfer is made is itself liable to eventual decay unless kept stable than nitrate and infinitely preferable to magnetic (video) tape, which is not only perishable but is unsuitable for reproducing the character of the original film. It may be that some time in the future it will prove possible to been demonstrated to be a practical possibility yet

The aim ofrestoration is to reproduce the moving image in as close as possible to that in which it was originally shown. But all copies that are made are necessarily imperfect. For a start; they have had to be duplicated from one base on to another; with an inevitable loss of some of the original quality It is also extremely difficult to such as tinting  and given the expense, is far from Many films which were originally coloured are now only seen, if at all, in black and white form. being

To appreciate a silent film in the form in which it was originally seen by audiences, it is necessary to have the Iare luck of seeing an original nitrate   print (increasingly difficult because ofmodern fire regulations) and even then it has to be recognized that each copy of a film has its own unique history and every showing will vary according to which print is shown and under effects, mean that the modern showing of silent films rough approximation of what silent film screening was like for audiences at the time. good being

## Early Cinema

In the first two decades of its existence the cinema developed rapidly. What in 1895 had been a mere novelty had by 1915 become an established industry The earliest moving snapshots, barely one minute in length and often consisting ofjust asingle shot:. were regularly five to ten minutes and employed changes of scene and camera position to tell the arrival of the first 'featurelength' films, there ally   emerged new set of conventions for handling complex narratives\_ No longer was the film show a curiosity sandwiched into variety of other spectacles, from singing or circus acts to magic lantern shows. Instead specialist venues had been created, exclusively devoted to the exhibition of films, and supplied by a number oflarge production and distribution companies, based in major cities, who first sold and then increasingly rented films to exhibitors all over the world. became Los Angeles-Hollywood. they gradu-

These terms need to be used with caution, as can imply that the cinema of the early years was only there as a precursor of Hollywood and the classical style which followed. making prevalent in the early years were never entirely OI classical modes, even in America, and many cinemas went on rate non-Hollywood in their practices for many years to come. But it remains true that much of the development that took place in the years from 1906 or 1907 can be seen as was to become the Hollywood system, in both formal and industrial terms . they

For the purposes ofthis book, therefore, we have divided the period into two. The first half, the beginnings up to about 1906, we have simply called early cinema, while the second half, from 1907 to the mid-1910s, we have bridge between the distinctive modes of early cinema and those which came later. Broadly speaking, the early cinema is disthe use direct   presentational and draws heavily on existing conventions of photography and theatreIt is only in the transitional period that specifically cinematic conventions really start to develop; and the cinema acquires the means of creating its distinctive forms of narrative illusion from

## INDUSTRY

Various nations lay claim to the invention of moving pictures, but the cinema, like so many other technological innovations, has no precise originating moment and owes its birth to no particularcountry and noparticular person. In fact, one can trace the origins ofcinema to such diverse sources as sixteenth century Italian experiments with the camera obscura, various early nineteenth-century optical toys, and host of practices of visual   representation such as dioramas and panoramas In the last decade of the nineteenth century, efforts to project continuously moving  images on to screen intensified and inventorsJentrepreneurs in several countries presented the 'first' moving pictures to the marvelling public: Edison in the United States; the Lumière brothers in France; Max Skladanowsky in Germany; and William Friese Greene in Great Britain. Noneofthese men can be called the primary originator of the film medium only favourable conjunction of technical circumstances made such an 'invention' possible at this particular moment: improvements in photographic development; the invento through projector; and the application of precision engineering and instruments to projector design. loop

In spite of the internationalization of both film style and technology; the United States and few European

countries retained hegemony over film production, diswere arguably the most important, if not in terms of stylistic innovation, an area in which competed with the British and the Americans, then certainly in terms of market dominance at home and internationally. Pride of place must be given to the Lumière brothers, who are frequently; although perhaps inaccurately, credited with projecting the first moving pictures to a paying audience. Auguste and Louis Lumière owned photographic equip ment factory and experimented in their spare time with designing camera Cinémato was first demonstrated on 22 March 1895 at meeting of the Société d'Encouragement à lIndustrie Nationale. Subsequent to this prestigious début, the Lumières continued to publicize their camera as scientific instrument, exhibiting it at photographic congresses and conferences of   learned societies\_ In December 1895, however, executed their most famous and influential demonstration; projecting ten films to a paying audience at the Grand Café in Paris they they

Upon seeing some of the Lumières' films, Méliès immediately recognized the potential of the new medium, although he took it in a very different direction from his more 'scientifically inclined countrymen Méliès's Star Film Company began production in 1896, and by the spring of 1897 had its own studio outside Paris in Montreuil Producing hundreds of films between 1896 and 1912 and establishing distribution offces in London, Barcelona, and Berlin by 1902and in New York by 1903 , Méliès popularity began to wane in 1908 as the films of the transitional cinema began to different kind of entertainment and by 1911 virtually the only Méliès films released were Westerns produced by Georges's brother Gaston in Texas studio.

The Lumières may not even have been the 'first' to project moving pictures on a screen to a paying audience; this honour probably belongs to the German Max Skladanowsky; who had done the same in Berlin two months before the Cinématographe's famed public exhibition But despite 'scooped by business acumen and marketing skill permitted them to become almost instantly known throughout Europe and the United States and secured place for them in flm helped in both regards, initially giving it several advantages over its competitors in terms of production and exhibition. Its relative lightness (16 lb. compared to the several hundred of Edison's Kinetograph) its ability to function as camera, projector; and film developer, and its lack of dependence upon electric current (it was hand-cranked and illuminated by limelight) all made it extremely portable and adaptable.

It became one of the most important French film producers during the early period, and was primarily responsible for the French dominance of the early cinema market. PathéFrères was founded in 1896 by Charles Pathé, who followed an aggressive policy of acquisition and expansion; acquiring the Lumières' patents as early as 1902, and the Méliès Film Company before the First World War. Pathé also expanded abroad,   exploiting markets ignored by other distributors, and making his firm's name practically synonymous with the cinema in many Third World countries. He created subsidiary production companies in many European nations: Hispano Film (Spain); Pathé-Russe   (Russia); Film d'Arte  Italiano; and Pathé Britannia. In 1908 Pathé distributed twice as many films in the United States as all the indigenous manufacturers combined Despite this initial French dominance however; various American studios, primary among them the Edison Manufacturing Company; the American Muto scope Biograph Company of America (after 1909 simply the Biograph Company), and the Vitagraph Company of America (all founded in the late 1890s) had already created solid basis for their country's future domination of world cinema

The 'invention' ofthe moving picture is often associated with the name of Thomas Alva Edison, but, in accordance with contemporary industrial practices, Edison's moving picture machines were actually produced by a team of technicians working at his laboratories in West Orange, New by the Englishman William Kennedy Laurie Dickson. Dickson and his associates began working on moving pictures in 1889 and by 1893 had built the Kinetograph, Kinetoscope; peep-show-like viewing machine in which

Until the spring of 1896 the Edison Company devoted novelty of the Kinetoscope parlours wore off and sales of the machines fell off, Thomas Edison began to rethink his commitment to individually oriented exhibition\_ He acquired the patents to a projector whose key mechanism had been designed by Thomas Armat and Francis Jenkins, who had lacked the capital for the commercial jected an image on to screen, was advertised under Edison's name and premièred in New York City in April of 1896. Six films were shown, five produced by the Edison Company and one, Rough at Dover, by the Englishman R W. Paul. These brief films, 40 feet in length and lasting twenty seconds, were spliced end to end to form enabling each film to be repeated up to half a dozen times The sheer novelty of moving pictures , rather than their story, was the attraction for the first film audiences. Within a year there were several hundred Vitascopes giving shows in various locations throughout the United States Sea

His company was the first to market commercially viable moving picture machine, albeit one designed individual viewers rather than mass audiControlling the rights to the Kinetograph and Kinetoscope; Edison immediately embarked upon plans for commercial   exploitation, entering into business agreements that led to the establishment of Kinetoscope parlours around the country.

In these early years Edison had two chief domestic rivals\_ In 1898 two former vaudevillians, James Stuart Blackton and Albert Smith, founded the Vitagraph Company of America initially to make films for exhibition in conwith their own vaudeville acts.

Producers sold rather than rented their films; a practice which forestalled the development of permanent exhibition sites until the second decade of the cinema's history

As opposed to the strict division of labour and assemblyline practices that characterized the Hollywood studios, production during this period was non-hierarchical and truly collaborative. One of the most important early film 'directors was Edwin S. Porter, who had worked as a hired projectionist and then as an independent exhibitor. Porter joined the Edison Company in 1900, first as a mechanic and then as head of production. Despite his nominal position, Porter only controlled the technical aspects of filming and editing while other Edison employees with theatrical experience took charge of directing the actors and the mise-en-scène. Other American studios seem to have practised similar At Vitagraph,   James in front of and behind the camera, one and the other shooting, and then reversing their roles for the next film. In similar fashion, the members of the British Brighton school both owned their production companies and functioned as cameramen.

This long-shot style is shot, the latter appellation stemming from the supposed resemblance to an audience member would For this reason, pre-1907 film is often accused of more theatrical than cinematic, although the tableau style also replicates the perspective commonly seen in such other period media as postcards and stereographs, and early film-makers derived their inspiration as much from these and other visual texts as from the theatre. have being

However, there were some multi-shot films produced during this the pre-1907 years into two subsidiary periods: 18941902/3, when the majority of films consisted of one shot and were what we would today call documentaries, known then, after the French usage, as actualities; and 1903 7, when the multi-shot, fiction film gradually began to dominate poral and causal relations between shots They

A gardener waters a lawn, a steps on the hose, halting the flow of water; the gardener peers questioningly at the spigot, the douses the gardener; who chases, catches, and spanks the boy. The film is shot with stationary camera in the standard tableau style of the period. At point in the action the trying to escape chastisement, exits the frame and the gardener follows; leaving the screen blank for two seconds. A modern film-maker would pan the camera to follow the characters Or cut to the offscreen action, but the Lumières did neither, providing an emblematic instance of the preservation of the space of the pro-filmic event taking precedence over story causality Or temporality. boy key

Unlike the Lumières, Georges Méliès always shot in his studio, staging action for the camera, his films showing fantastical events that could not happen in real life' Although all Méliès's films conform to the standard period tableau style, are also replete with magical appearances and disappearances, achieved through what cine matographers call  'stop action' , that is, stopping the camera, having the actor enter or exit the shot, and then starting the camera to create the illusion that character has simply vanished or materialized Méliès's films have played a debates over the   supposed theatricality of early cinematic style. Whereas scholars had previously thought that stop action effects required no editing and hence concluded that Mélexamination of in fact, produced through splicing or editing.

Despite this cinematic manipulation of the pro-filmic space, Méliès's films remain in many ways excessively the atrical, presenting as if it were being performed on stage, characteristic have in common with many of the fiction films of the pre-1907 period. Not only does the camera replicate the proscenium arch perin a shallow playing space between the painted flats and the front of the 'stage" and characters enter Or exit either from the wings or through traps.

the period's fascination with travel and transportation. The train film, established by the Lumières, practically became genre of its studio released version, sometimes shooting a moving train from stationary camera and sometimes positioning a camera on the front of or inside the train to produce a travelling shot, since the illusion of moving through space seemed to thrill early audiences. scenes both exotic and familiar; and replicating in motion the immensely popular postcards and stereographs of the period. Public events; such as parades, world's fairs, and funerals, also provided copious material for early camthe travelogue and the public event film consisted of selfcontained, individual shots, but pro ducers did offer combinations that, for example; an exhibitor could project several discrete shots of the same event, and so give his audience a fuller and more varied picture ofit. Early film-makers also replicated popular amusements, such as vaudeville acts and boxing matches, that could be relatively easily reenacted for the camera. The first Kinetoscope films în 1894 featured vaudeville performers, including contortionists, performing animals, and dancers, as well as scenes from as selfcontained units and were marketed as such, but exhibitors had the option of putting them together to form an evening's entertainment. By 1897 the popular filmed boxing matches could potentially run for an hour: The same was true of another ofthe most popular of early

For many years film theorists pointed to the Lumière and Méliès films as the originating moment of the disgiven that the Lumières for the most part filmed 'real events and Méliès staged events.

A compilation of shots of the play's key events A third group of films told one-shot mini-narratives, most often of humorous nature. Some were gag films, resembling the Lumières Watering the Gardener, in which the comic action takes place in the pro-filmic event, as for instance in Elopement by Horseback (Edison, 1891), where a young man seeking to elope with his sweetheart engages in wrestling match with the girl's father. Others relied for their humour upon trick effects such as stop action, superimposition, and this form was also seen in some of the early films made of the English   Brighton school. These films became increasingly complicated, sometimes involving more than one shot. In Williamson's film The Big Swallow (1901), the passer-by. The second shot replicates the photographer's viewpoint through the camera lens, and shows the passer by's head growing bigger and bigger as he approaches the shot of the photographer and his camera falling into black void ends with shot of the passer-by walking away munching contentedly.

## 1902/3-1907

In this period, the multi-shot film emerged as the norm rather than the exception, with films no longer treating the individual shot as selfcontained unit of meaning but linking one shot may have been succession of shots to capture and emphasize the highpoints of the action rather than construct either linear narrative causality or clearly establish temporal-spatial relations. As befits the 'cinema ofattractions' , the editing was intended to enhance visual pleasure rather than to refine narrative developments . using

One of the strangest editing devices used in this period was overlapping action; which resulted film-makers= desire both to preserve the pro-filmic space and to emphasize the important action by essentially showing it twice. Georges Méliès's Trip to the Moon, perhaps the most famous film of 1902, covers the landing of a space capsule the capsule hits the man in the moon in the eye, and his expression changes from a toa grimace In the second shot, taken from the the capsule once lands. These two shots, which show the same event twice; can disconcert modern viewer. This repetition of action around Do Things on the Bowery; directed by Edwin S. Porter for the Edison Manufacturing Company. An irate waiter ejects a customer unable to pay his bill. In from grin again They

Linking shots through dissolves was not in fact unusual in this period, and one can see another example in Alice in Wonderland (Hepworth, 1903) However; another English film-maker; James Williamson, a member of the Brighton school, made two films in 1901, Stop Thief? and Firel, which direct cuts continue the action from shot to shot. joint from butcher, motivating connections by the diagonal movement of characters through each of the individual shots; the thief and then his pursuers entering the frame at the back and exi the frame past the camera. The fact that the camera remains with the scene movement motivates the editing. Film-makers found this iting

an interior shot the waiter throws the man out and hurls customer emerges from the restaurant followed closely by Man, overlapping action is used not to cover interior and in closer scale In the frst shot woman accepts her suitor's flowers and rather than a 'match cut' , in which the action picks up at the beginning of the second shot from where it left off at conventions, a closer shot shows her repeating precisely the same action

While overlapping action was a common means of linking shots, film-makers during this period also experimented with other methods of establishing spatial and temporal relations \_ One sees an instance of this in Trip to the Moon: having landed on the moon, the intrepid French explorers encounter   unfriendly extraterrestrials   (who remarkably resemble those 'hostile natives the French were encountering in their colonies at this very timel) the safety of Earth, their descent covered in four shots In the first shot, the capsule leaves the moon, exiting at the bottom of the frame. In the second shot, the capsule moves from the capsule moves from the top of the frame to the water, and in the fourth the capsule moves the water's surface to the sea-bed. This sequence is filmed much as it might be today, with the movement of the spaceship following the convention of directional continuity; that is, anobject a character should appear to continue moving in the same direction from shot to shot, the consistent move ment serving to establish the   spatial and temporal relationships between individual shots. But while modern film-maker would cut directly from shot to shot, Méliès dissolved from shot to shot, a transitional device that now implies a temporal ellipsis. In this regard, then, the sequence can still be confusing for a modern viewer top from

Even shots that approximate the point of view of character within the fiction  and which are now associated with the externalization of thoughts and emotions, were then there more to provide visual pleasure than narrative film-making of the Brighton school, Grandma's Reading Glasses (G. A. Smith, Warwick Trading Company, 1900), a little looks through his grandmother's spectacles at a variety of objects , watch, a canary, and a kitten which the film shows in inserted close-ups. In The Shoe Clerk (Edison[Porter, 1903) a shoeshop assistant flirts with his female customer. A cut-in approximates his view of her This close-up insert is an not only of the visual pleasure afforded by the 'cinema of attractions but of the early cinema's voyeuristic treatment of the female body. Despite the fact that their primary purpose is not to emphasize narrative developments, these shots attribution to a character in the film distinguishes them the totally unmotivated closer views in The Great Train Robbery and Raid on a Coiner's Den. boy from

During this period, film-makers also experimented with cinematically fracturing the space of the pro-filmic event primarily to enhance the viewers' visual pleasure through acloser shotofthe action rather than to emphasize details Robbery includes medium shot of the outlaw leader, Barnes his revolver directly at the camera, which in modern prints usually concludes the film. The Edison catalogue, however, informed exhibitors that the shot could come at the beginning or the end of the film. Narratively non-specific shots of this nature became common, as in the British film Raid on a Coiner's Den (Alfred Collins , 1904), which begins with a close-up insert of three hands coming into the frame different directions , one holding pistol, another of handcuffs, and third clenched fist. In Porter's own one shot film Photographing a Female Crook, moving camera produces the closer view as it dollies into a woman contorting her face to prevent the police from an accurate mug shot. firing quite from pair taking

The editing strategies of the pre-1907 'cinema of attractions were primarily designed to enhance visual pleasure tell simple stories and audiences undoubtedly derived narrative, as well as visual, pleasure Despite the absence of internal strategies to construct spatial-temporal relations and linear narratives; the original audiences made sense of these films, even though modern viewers can find them all but incoherent. This is because the films of the 'cinema of attractions'  relied heavily on their audiences' knowledge ofother texts, from which the films were directly derived or indirectly related . new medium, but were not working in cinema had roots in the rich popular culture of the age, drawing heavily during its infant years upon the narrative and visualconventions ofother forms of popular being 'noncinematic' and overly theatrical, and indeed dramatic theatrical   practices, but for the most   part lengthy theatrical dramas   provided an inappropriate ration as films grew longer during the transitional period.

In addition to mimicking the visual conventions of other media, film-makers derived manyoftheir films stories already well known to the audience. Edison adver tised its Night before Christmas (Porter; 1905) by saying the film 'closely follows the time-honored Christmas legend by Clement Clarke Moore' Both Biograph and Edison made films of the hit song 'Everybody Works but Father' graph based its Happy Hooligan series on a cartoon tramp character whose popular comic strip ran in several New York newspaper Sunday supplements. presented synoptic versions of fairly complex narratives, ences' pre existing knowledge ofthe subject-matter rather than upon cinematic conventions for the requisite narrative coherence. LÉpopée napoléonienne The Epic of Napoleon' , 1903-4 Pathé) presents Napoleon's life through series of tableaux, drawing upon well-known historical incidents (the coronation; the burning of Moscow) and anecdotes   (Napoleon standing for the sleeping sentry) but with no attempt at causal linear connection or narrative development among its fifteen shots. In similar fashion, multi-shot films such as Ten Nights in a Barroom (Biograph, 1903) and Uncle Tom's Cabin (Vitagraph, 1903) presented only the highlights of these familiar and oftperformed melodramas, with shot connections provided not by editing strategies but by the audiences' knowledge ofintervening events. The latter film, however; appears to be one of the earliest to have intertitles. These title cards, summarizing the action of the shot which followed appeared at the same time as the multi-shot film, around 1903-4, and seem to indicate a recognition on the part of the producers of the necessity for internally rather than externally derived narrative coherence\_ from Many guard

## EXHIBITION

Cinema initially existed not as popular commercial medium but as scientific and educational novelty. The cinematic apparatus itself and its mere ability to reproduce movement constituted the attraction, rather than any particular film. In many countries, moving picture machines were first seen at world's fairs and scientifc its Kinetoscope at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair although it failed to assemble the machines in time; and moving picture machines were featured in several areas of the 1900 Universal Exposition in Paris.

Fairly rapidly, cinema exhibition was integrated into pre existing venues of 'popular culture' and 'refined culture' , although the establishment of venues specifically the exhibition of films did not come until 1905 in the United Sta little later elsewhere. In the United for

Magic lanterns, early versions of slide projectors often lit by kerosene lamps, proved particularly important infuence upon flms, for magic lantern practices permitted the projection of 'moving pictures which set pre cedents for the cinematic representation of time and often had elaborate lever and pulley mechanisms to produce movement within specially manufactured slides Long slides slowly through the slide holder produced the equivalent of a cinematic pan. Two slide holders mounted on the same lantern permitted the operator to produce a dissolve by switching rapidly between slides The use of two slides also permitted 'editing' , as operators could cut from long shots to close-ups, exteriors tointeriors, and from characters to what were magic lantern show. Magic lantern lectures given by travelling exhibitors such as the Americans Burton John Stoddard provided precedents for the train and travelogue films, the lantern illustrations often intercutting exterior views of the train, interior views of the traveller pulled

Early exhibition in Britain, as in most European countries, followed a similar pattern to the United States, with primary exhibition venues being fairgrounds, music halls, and disused shops. Travelling showmen played a crucial role in establishing the popularity of the new medium, making films an important attraction at fairgrounds Given that fairs and music halls attracted primarily working-class patrons, early film audiences in Britain, as well as on the Continent, had a more homogeneous class base than in the United States

In New York City, the Eden Musée put together special show on the Spanish-American lantern slides and twenty or more films from different producers an exhibitor; with films and 'stringing the pictures together into little sets Or episodes' with commentary linking the material together. When improvements in the projector permitted showing films that lasted more than fifty seconds, exhibitors began splicing twelve or more films together to form programmes on particular subjects. Not only could exhibitors manipulate the visual aspects of their programmes , also added sound of various kinds, for, contrary to popular opinion, the silent cinema was never silent.

## Transitional Cinema

try in the United States and Europe began to emulate contemporary industrial capitalist enterprises. Spe cialization increased as production, distribution, and exhibition became separate and distinct areas , although some producers, particularly in the United States, did attempt to establish oligopolistic control over the entire industry. The greater length of films, coupled with the unrelenting demand from exhibitors for regular production practices, as well as an increased division of establishment of permanent exhibition sites aided the rationalization of distribution and exhibition procedures as well as maximizing profits, which put the industry on a more stable footing. In most countries, early cinemas held fairly small audiences, and profits depended upon frequent changes of fare. This situation encouraged producers to make short, standardized films to meet the constant demand. This demand was enhanced through the construction ofa star system patterned after the theatrical model which guaranteed the steady loyalty of the newly emerging mass audience.

of narrative integration' no longer relied upon viewers' extra-textual knowledge but rather employed cinematic conventions to create internally coherent narrativesThe

average film reached a standard length of a 1000-foot reel and ran for about fifteen minutes , although the so-called 'feature film running an hour or more, also made its first appearance during these years. In general, the emergence of the 'cinema of narrative integration' coincided with the cinema's move toward the cultural mainstream and its establishment as the first truly mass medium. Film companies responded to pressures from state and civic organizations with internal schemes and other strategies that gained both films and film industry degree of social respectability.

## INDUSTRY

Before War, European film industries dominated the international market, with France, Italy, and Denmark the strongest exporters. From 60 to 70 per cent of all the films imported into the United States and Europe were French\_ Pathé the strongest of the French relatively small domestic demand. It established offices in major cities around the world, supplemented them with travelling salesmen who sold films and equipment, and, as a result, dominated the market in countries that could support only one film company.

US producers faced strong competition European product within their own country for; despite the pro liferation of relatively successful motion picture manufacturers during the transitional years , a high percentage from

of films screened in the USA still originated in Europe. Pathé opened a US offce in 1904,and by 1907 other foreign firms, British and Italian among them, were entering the US market on regular basis. Many of these distributed major importer of foreign films into the United States during theseyears and acompany that played a prominent role in the transition to the longer feature film. In 1907 French firms, particularly Pathé, controlled the American market; sharing it with other European countries: of the about 400 were domestic took note of this, and the trade press, established in this year with Moving Picture World, often complained about dealt with contemporary topics for their narrative incomprehensibility and, worse yet, un-American morals .

on distribution and exhibition rather than production; conceding American dominance in this area. American with Italian and French imports making up a substantial wellestablished industry of its own, was the second most with the powerful French and Italian industries in their own countries. American films were distributed outside Europe, but often not to the financial benefit of the prO duction studios, whogranted their British distributors the rights not only to the British Isles and some Continental countries but to British colonies as well.

Paradoxically; an earlier move to rationalize film distribution had resulted in a maximization of profits, and as a result US manufacturers initially concentrated on the domestic market. However; during these years began their well placed to step into the number one position in 1914, when European film industries were reeling from the effects of the outbreak of war. In 1907 Vitagraph became the first of the major US firms to establish overseas and in 1909 other American prO ducers established agencies in London which remained the European centre for American distribution until 1916. As a result the British industry tended to concentrate they being

During this period American film production took place mainly on theeastcoast, with an outpostor two in Chicago and some companies making occasional forays to the west coast and even to foreign locations. New York was the headquarters of three of the most important American companies: Edison had a studio in the Bronx, Vitagraph in Brooklyn, and Biograph in the heart of the Manhattan show-business district on Fourteenth Street. Other com-panies\_Solax and American Pathé  among them-had studios across the Hudson in Fort Lee, New Jersey, which also served as prime location for many of the New York only one ofthe many 'Jersey' Westerns shot in the vicinity So over-used were certain settings that contemporary anecdote claimed that two companies once shot on either side of a Fort Lee fence, sharing the same gate.

However, Los Angeles did not become the centre of the American industry until the First World War.

Around 1903, the rise of film exchanges led to a crucial numbers in 1906, made the film industry a much more profitable business, encouraging others to join Edison, Biograph, and Vitagraph as producers. Until this time the companies had sold rather than rented their product to exhibitors. While this   worked well for the travelling showmen who changed show to exhibition sites. Dependent upon attracting repeat cusneeded frequent changes of programme, and so long as this involved having to purchase a large number of films it was prohibitively expensive. The film exchanges solved this problem by buying the films from the manufacturers and renting them to exhibitors, making permanent exhibition venues feasible and increasing the medium's popularity. Improvements in projectors also facilitated the rise of permanent venues, since exhibitors no longer had to rely on the production companies to supply operators.

By 1908 the new medium was flourishing as never before, with the nickelodeonsso called because of their initial admission price of 5 cents-springing up on every street corner, and their urban patrons consumed by the But the film industry itself was in disarray. Neighbouring nickelodeons competed to rent the same films, or actually rented the same films and competed for the same audience while unscrupulous exchanges were likely to supply exhibitors with films that had been in release that rain-like scratches obscured the images. The exchanges and exhibitors now threatened to wrest economiccontrolofthe the producers. In addition civil authorities and private reform groups, alarmed by the rapid growth of the new medium and its perceived associations with workers and immigrants, began calling for film censorship and regulation of the nickelodeons\_ long

In 1910 the MPPC began business practices that pre those of the Hollywood studios, establishing a arate distribution arm, the General Film Company. This instituted standing orders (an early form ofblock booking) and zoning requirements unnecessary competition by prescribing which exhibitors within rates for newly released films versus lower ones for those that had been in circulation, encouraged the dif ferentiation of first-run venues from those showing the older and less expensive product, another hallmark of the coming studio system. saged sep

The licensed film exchanges had to lease them after a certain period. Only licensed exhibitors, sup posedly vetted by the MPPC to ensure certain safety and sanitation standards and required to pay weekly royalty these   exchanges. The Trust's arrangements had an immediate impact on the foreign competition so that by the end of 1909 imports constituted less than half of released films, a percentage films manifested in the Trust's exclusionary tactics may have encouraged European studios to produce 'classic' subjects,   literary adaptations and historical   epics for example, which were more acceptable to the American market.

Like the American industry; the French industry came into its own in 1907-8. Film was no Ionger considered a poor cousin of photography but rather major entertainment which threatened the popularity of more traditional such as the theatre. The importance of the medium was shown by the remarkable increase in the number of Parisian cinemas , from only ten in 1906 to eighty-seven by the end of 1908, as well as the appearance in that year of the first newspaper column devoted to the moving pictures \_ Pathé remained the most important of the studios, its only serious domestic competition coming from the Gaumont Company, founded by Léon Gaumont in 1895 Although less sig presence\_ from 1905 to 1915 Gaumont had the largest regular

Before 1908, several factors had militated against the development of a cinematic star system. Initially, most moving picture actors were transient, working on the stage as well, did not remain with any particular company situation changed in 1908 as studios began to establish film action was usually staged too far away from the camera for audiences to recognize actors' features, a precondition audience loyalty was to the studio trademark rather than the actors, and so most companies, both Trust and inde pendent, resisted a star system until about 1910, fearing it would shift the economic balance of power (as indeed it did to some extent) For this reason, the Biograph Company, which had some of the most popular actors under contract, would not reveal its players" names until 1913 iment; as early as 1909, with publicizing their use of the atrical stars; the Edison Company advertising Miss Cecil Spooner in its adaptation of Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, and Vitagraph inserting a title into its Oliver Twist stating that Miss Elita Proctor appeared as 'Nancy Sikes' By the next year, the mechanics of star publicity were set in motion, as Kalem made lobby cards ofits stockcompany for display in nickelodeons Other companies followed suit, distributing photographs to fans as well as exhibitors and sending their stars out on personal appearances . The biggest American stars of this period were Florence Lawrence of IMP (formerly of Biograph) Florence Turner and Maurice Costello of Vitagraph, and, of course, Pickford of Biograph. Other countries also gave prominence to leading actors and, more commonly; actresses in this of both the German and Danish cinema, while in Italy films which also produced. and long period Mary they

The box office success of Feuillade's serials enabled Gaumont to overtake Pathé as the country's most powerWorld War which caused the end of French domination of international markets\_

The Italian film industry had a relatively latestart, dominated as it was by Lumières in the early years. The Cines Company; founded by the Italian aristocrats   Marchese ant producers ofthe silent period Cines setthe pace forthe industry as a whole by producing the first Italian costume film, Lapresa di Roma (The Capture ofRome, 1905), starring the famous theatrical actor Carlo Rosaspina. During its initial years, Cines concentrated mostly on con sixty fiction films and actualities. 1907 saw the real exhibition flourishing. Cines had built its studio in Rome, Turin, and several other producers built studios in Milan In this year there were 500 cinemas in the country with thirty

By 1908, then, the Italian industry was able to compete on the international market with France and the United States, the Italian studios strengthening their position through the production ofhistorical spectaculars. Ambrosio's first version of Gli ultimi giorni di Pompeí (The Last of Pompeii) began rage forthecostumedrama, manyofwhich dealt with Roman history or adapted Italian literary masterpieces: Giulio Cesare (1909), Bruto (1909), and Il Conte of building the massive sets and the large casts of extrasnecessary forthesespectacleintensive filmsenabled the Italians to differentiatetheir product from thatoftheir foreign rivals and break into the international market without massive expenditure.

## FILM PRODUCTION

In all the major producing countries, film production during this was marked by an increasing spe period

cialization and division of labour that brought the film industry into line with other capitalist enterprises. In the early film-making was collaborative enterprise, but the emergence of the director coincided with the appearance of other specialists, such as script-writers, property men, and who worked under his direction. the bigger American studios employed several directors, giving each his own cast and crew and requiring him to turn out one reel week. This led to the creation of another job category; the producer, who oversaw the whole process, coordinating between the duction units headed by the company's founders, James Stuart Blackton and Albert E. Smith, and their employee James Bernard French. These men operated the cameras and had an assistant responsible for the staging of the action. Vitagraph reorganized its production practices in 1907, putting a director in charge ofeach unit and making was the sole director from June 1908 until December 1909. By the time Griffith left in autumn 1913, six directors were shooting Biograph films under his supervision; while he also continued to direct his own unit. period Soon, yet

With the exception of certain films designed to lend American film industry during this period emphasized speed and quantity. The studio front offices for the most part disdained 'artistry' , since all films, whether artistic' OI not, sold for the same standard price per foot. In 1908 the average film was shot in single day at a cost of $200 s500, and averaged one reel\_ Or 1,000 feet, in length.

Until as director; the   Biograph Company had depended upon transient actors, but the new director developed his own stock company, integral to the period's ensemble style of film-making and, incidentally, presaging the Hollywood studios' practice of keeping actors under exclusive contract.  While Griffith had the primary responsibility and casting, by the time he arrived at the studio Biograph had story department that had been producing scripts, perhaps was standard practice for staff writers to prepare a script, often without consulting the director, although in the case of Biograph Griffith seems to with the story department. for hiring

story-telling, 'the cinema of narrative integration' , but conventions for constructing internally coherent narratives had not yet been established. In the transitional years , between 1907-8 and 1917, the formal elements of film-making all became subsidiary to the narrative, as lighting,   composition,   editing were all increasingly designed to help the audience follow story. Integral to these stories were psychologically credible characters , created through   performance editing, and dialogue intertitles, whose motivations and actions seemed realistic and helped to link together a film's disparate shots and scenes. These 'well-rounded' , believable characters,   resembling those of the then fashionable realist literature and drama, contrast sharply ters drawn from the melodrama and vaudeville comedy skits

In may have been an exception; the principal actors received scripts before the shooting occurred in order to prepare themselves for rehearsals, which became increasingly important as stories grew more intricate. Rehearsal time seems to have varied one studio to another, although by 1911 a trade press writer indicated that on average each scene was rehearsed from five to ten times. When Griffith arrived at Biograph, the front offce emphasized the rapid production of films, and discouraged lengthy rehearsals, the directors simply ensuring that the actors remained within camera range. By mid-1909, however, Griffith was already willing to devote half a day or more to rehearsal, reeler. again from

## THE BEGINNING OF NARRATIVE

There was 'crisis' in transitional cinema around 1907, signalled by complaints in the trade press about lack of narrative clarity; as well as by exhibitors of lectures in an attempt to make films understandable to their audiences Films were poised between an emphasis upon visual  pleasure, 'the cinema of attractions' and

The increased use of edi and the decreased distance between camera and actors most obviously distinguish the films of the transitional from their pre decessors. The tableau or proscenium arch shot, showing the actors entire bodies as well as the space above and below them characterized the early cinema However, towards the beginning of the transitional the Vitagraph Company began using the so-called '9-foot line~ staging the action about 9 feet from the camera, a scale that showed the actors from the ankles up. At around the same time in France Pathé and companies under its influence Film d'Art and SCAGL, also adopted the By 1911 the camera had moved yet closer, producing the three quarter shot that became the pre dominant scale of the transitional cinema and indeed of the entire silent period. In addition to moving the camera closer to the actors, film-makers also moved the actors closer to the camera. In chase films the actors had exited the shots in close proximity to the camera, but during the transitional period the practice became standardized, deliberately employed to enhance dramatic effects; as in which gangster slinks a wall until he is seen in medium close-up. period period along

The decreased distance between action and camera not only enabled identification of the actors and the develop ment of the star system, but also contributed to the increased emphasis upon individualized characters and facial expression. Editing was also developed for this end; both to emphasize moments of psychological intensity and to externalize characters thoughts and emotions The three-quarter scale already permitted audiences to see the actors" faces more clearly than before, but flmmakers often cut even closer at climactic points. This was the characters emotions, and not, as in early films like The Great Train Robbery simply for shock value. For

burglars menace telegraph operator (Blanche Sweet) and attempt to break into her office. As Sweet desperately cuts from three-quarter to medium shot, allowing closer view of her fearful expression.

Editing was also used more directly to convey charac: ters adopted the theatrical 'vision scene' using double exposure to put the character and a literal embodiment of externalized thoughts in the same frame Life of an American Fireman (Edison, 1902), for example, uses this device to show a freman thinking of an imperilled family who appear in a balloon slightly above him and to his right. This convention continued in the transitional period, as in The Life Drama of Napoleon Bonaparte and the divorced and distraught Empress reaches out to imposed vision of her erstwhile husband . But the flm's companion reel, Napoleon; the Man of Destiny; approaches the conventional flashback structure of the Hollywood 'presentday' shot of the character as he 'thinks of his past, the film cuts from him to re

The transitional period also saw the emergence of the editing pattern thatis most closely associated withcharac ter subjectivity: the pointofview shot; in which cuts from a character to what the character sees and then back to the character. This pattern did not become fully conventionalized until the Hollywood period, but flmmakers during the transitional period experimented with various means of 'showing' what characters saw. In an early example, Francesca da Rimini (Vitagraph, 1907). there is a cut from tableau-scale shot of a character looking at Operator, Enoch Arden (1911), and other films, Griffith cuts between characters looking through window to what they see, although the eyeline match seems 'imperfect' by today's standards

This last kind ofediting  ofcourse, notonly externalized characters' thoughts but helped establish the spatial and temporal relations crucial to narrative coherence, both in the same scene (roughly, actions occurring at the same place and time) and between scenes taking place at the same time in different locations In the earlier period film-makers occasionally broke down the space of a shot selecting details for closer examination; as in Grandma's Reading Glasses: While not as prevalent as it was later to become, this analytical editing was sometimes used in the transitional to highlight narratively important the earlier period, simply to provide visual pleasure\_ In The   Lonedale   Operator, for period

example, telegraph operator's office, she holds them at with what appears to be revolver but While analytical editing was comparatively rare, conventions for linking the different spaces of one scene together; to orientate the viewer spatially, became established practice. In fact, part of the suspense in The Lonedale Operator depends upon the viewer having a clear idea of the film's spatial relations. When the telegraph operator first arrives at work, she walks from the railway office's porch into an outer room and then into an inner room\_ the actress exits each shot at screen right and reenters at screen left. When the burglars break through the outermost door, the viewer knows exactly how much further they must go to reach the terrified woman. Here, character movement links the shots, but various other conventions , many relating to the relative position of the camera in also arose for relations . bay

The Lonedale Operator also provides an example of an editing pattern primarily associated with the name of its cutting, parallel action, or parallel editing through which he constructed his   spine-tingling   last-minute rescues Several pre Griffith films, however, show that, while the may have conventionalized   parallel The Mill Girl and The Hundred-to One-Shot, cross-cut between different locations, the latter even featuring a somewhat attenuated last-minute rescue. Several Pathé films from 1907-8 alsocontain fairly brief parallel editing sequences , the plot and editing of one, A Narrow Escape (1908), preiest films, Griffith experimented with cutting between pursued, pursuer; and potential rescuer; and he and other American directors soon beyond the fairly elementary form seen in French films. The climax of The Lonedale Operator, for example, cuts from the menaced heroine, to the menacing burglars breaking speeding loco motive, to an exterior tracking shot of the onrushing train down

When Griffth first began directing at Biograph in 1908 his films averaged about seventeen shots, increasing fiveBiographs probably feature more shots per film than those produced by other American studios; such as Vitagraph, during the same years, but American film-makers as general rule tended to rely more heavily on editing than did their European counterparts, who were concerned more with the miseen-scène and the possibilities of staging in depth. American films tended to stage the action on shallow plane; with actors entering 'exiting from the and

sides. Particularly toward the beginning of the transitional period, even attempt to disguise their theatricality. By contrast, European films, particularly the French and Italian, began to create a sense of deep space not possible in the theatre Lowering the camera to waist level from its previous eye level facilitated shooting in depth; the reduction of the empty space above the actors" both larger, closer view of the characters and much more contrast between characters closer to and further from the camera, permitting the staging of action in the fore dimensional sets for interior scenes, often with doors that gave glimpses of an even deeper space behind the set, added to the illusion of depth. The use of doorways and contrasting light and shadows often enhanced the feeling of space in exterior shots, as seen in Romeo and Juliet (Film d'Arte Italiana, 1909). In one shot, Romeo returns to Verona and walks through the dark shadow under an arch into the well-lit deep space behind. The next shot, Juliet's funeral procession, is a graphic match cut to the shadowy arched doorway of cast. The film holds the shot long enough for the extras to past the camera, the lengthy procession drawing the eye back to the church door: they deep huge

The American cinema's emphasis on editing rather than mise-en-scène was coupled with the development of a new 'cinematic' performance style that contributed to the creation of credible, individualized characters. Film acting began increasingly to resemble that of the 'realist' drama and to reject the codified conventions of an older performance style, associated primarily with the melo drama. OI was   predicated upon the assumption that acting bore no relation to 'real OI everyday life. Actors expressed themselves through pre-established lexicon of gestures and poses, all Movements were broad distinct, and forcefully   per-formed\_ By contrast, the newer OI 'verisimilar" style assumed that actors should mimic everyday behaviour. Actors abandoned the standard and conventionalized poses of the 'histrionic' style and externalized characters thoughts and emotions through facial expression, small individuated movements, and the use of props.

The changing use of intertitles during the transitional individualized characters. Initially, intertitles had been lengthy descriptions of the upcoming action. Gradually; shorter expository titles dispersed throughout the scene replaced these lengthy titles. More importantly; dialogue titles   began to appear from 1910 Film-makers experimented with the placement of these titles, first inserting them before the shot in which the words were uttered but by about 1913 cutting in the title just as the character spoke. This had the effect of forging a stronger connection between words and actor, serving further to individuate the characters.

These contemporary dramas display a more consistent and intertitles than do any of the other genres. In these films, producers often emulated the narrative forms and characters of respectable contemporary entertainments , such as the 'realist' drama (the proverbial 'well-made' play) 'realist' literature, rather than, as in the earlier period, drawing upon vaudeville and magic lanterns. This emulation resulted   partially from the film industry's desire to attract broader audience while placating the ican middleclass culture as a respectable mass medium Integral to this strategy were the quality films, which the moment when the proliferation of permanent exhibition venues and the 'nickel madness caused cultural

In 1907 comedies the comic chase provided such an easy means for linking shots together. But the development of other means of the proliferation of different genres\_

Exhibitors made conscious effort to attract a wide audience by programming mix of subjects; comedies , Westerns,  melodramas, actualities , and forth. The studios planned their output to meet this demand for diversity. For example; in 1911 Vitagraph released a military film, Western, a comedy, and special feature, often costume film, each week. Nickelodeon audiences apparently loved Westerns (as.did European viewers), to such an extent that trade press writers began popular, particularly during the war's fiftieth anniversary, which fell in this period. By 1911 comedies no longer constituted the majority of fiction films, but still maintained significant presence. Responding to prejudice against 'vulgar' slapstick, studios began to turn out the first situation comedies; featuring continuing cast of characters in domestic settings; Biograph's Mr and Mrs Jones series, Vitagraph's John Bunny series, and Pathé's Max Linder series. In 1912 Mack Sennett revived the stick comedy when he devoted his Keystone Studios to the genre. Not numerous, but none the less significant; were the 'quality' films: literary adaptations, biblical epics, and slap

He tried his hand at both his parents' professions \_ without much success, until two tyro producers, Jesse L Lasky Goldwyn) invited him to direct American feature-length movic and one of the first township of Hollywood . A thunderously old-fashioned melodrama, it was a huge hit. By the end of 1914 DeMille, with five more pictures under his belt and hailed as one of the foremost young directors, was supervising four separate units shooting on the Lasky lot, later to become Paramount Studios .

DeMille's prodigious energy was matched, at this stage of his career, by an enthusiasm for innovation.

## EXHIBITION AND AUDIENCES

During the early years of film production, the dominance of the non-fiction film; and its exhibition in 'respectable' venues-vaudeville and opera-houses churches and lecture halls-kept the new medium from posing a threat to the cultural status quo. But the advent of the story film and the associated rise of the nickelodeons changed this situation, and resulted in a sustained assault against the film industry by state officials and private reform groups The industry's critics asserted that the dark, and unsafe nickelodeons showed unsuitable fare, were often located in tenement districts, and were patronized by the most unstable elements of American society who were all too vulnerable to the physical and moral hazards posed by the picture shows . There were demands that state authorities exhibition industry responded with several strategies designed to placate its critics: the emulation of respectable literature and drama; the production of literary historical, and biblical films; selfcensorship and cooperation with government officials in making exhibition sites safe and sanitary

Teachers and clergymen produced several studies testifying to cinema's deleterious effect upon the young while teachers associations and other groups for popular and continuing education denigrated the use of the cinema for amusement and urged increased production of scientific films teaching   purposes. In 1907 reformers joined together in the cinema reform movement (Kinoreformbewegung) and touted the new medium's potential a way to avoid more official censorship, the cinema reformers were successful in persuading the German industry to produce educational films, or Kulturfilme, that dealt with try, technology and crafts, medicine and hygiene; sports , history; religion, and military affairs . for

It was not only in the United States that film houses faced criticism and opposition in this period. Permanent exhibition sites appeared in Germany in 1910, a few years later than in the United States, but the rapid growth and increasing popularity of the new medium attracted the attention of state officials and private reform groups concerned about film's possible malign influence upon susceptible audiences and the nation's culture.

In 1912, literary intellectuals became interested in the by then predominant fiction film, urging adherence to aesthetic standards to elevate the story film to art rather than amusement. Theindustry responded with the Autorenfilm, or author film, the German version of the film dart. The first Autorenfilm, Der Andere (The Other One), was adapted from personality and starred the country's most famous actor, Albert Bassermann. The prestigious theatre director Max

Reinhardt followed with filmed versions of two popular plays, Eine venezianische  Nacht (A Venetian night' , 1913) and Insel der Seligen ('Island of the blessed' , 1913)

Britain had no real equivalent to the American nickelodeon period, although debates about cinema's cultural and social status paralleled those place across the Atlantic. By 1911, when film rental and permanent exhibition sites became standard , most cinemas mimicked the upmarket accoutrements of the legitimate theatre. Before this films were exhibited in variety of locations-the the primary venues of the early period as well as the so-called 'penny Although never as numerous and often more transient than the nickelodeons, these store-front shows were unsanitary and unsafe The first theatre devoted entirely to film exhibition seems to have been established in 1907, and, between the following year and the advent of the World War; films were increasingly exhibited in 'picture palaces' , the equivalent of the American 'movie palaces' , replete with uniformed for up to 1,000 OI even remained low enough to permit former patrons to continue to attend, all these anenities served to distance the cinema fromits previous associations with the music halls and the working class, to attract, as the trade press fervently hoped, a better class of customer. taking gaffs' being

Like their transatlantic counterparts, British filmmakers also pursued respectability through more positive tactics\_ In 1910 producer Will Barker the eminent theatrical actor-manager Sir Herbert Beerbohm-Tree E1,000 for appearing in a film version of Shakespeare's Henry VIII. Rather than selling the film outright to distributors , as was still the dominant practice, Barker gave one distributor exclusive rights to rent, but not to sell, the film, claiming that its high production cultural status required special treatment. Barker produced other films of a similar nature; establishing the 'exclusive' or 'quality' picture, the adjectives referring to both the films and their distribution. Hepworth and other producers followed Barker's lead, adapting contemporary plays and literary classics that would appeal to the customers now pa tronizing the upmarket theatres. In 1911 the Urban Company issued a catalogue of films suitable urged the industry to persuade government authorities to recognize the educational value of film, even arranging members of the London  County Council\_ paid

## EPILOGUE: TRANSITION TO FEATURE FILMS

By about 1913 the American film industry' s strategies for attaining respectability\_emulating respectable entertainments, internal censorship, and improved exhibition ent from what had been in 1908 when the medium had been the centre of a cultural crisis. Now a mass audience sat comfortably   ensconced in elaborate movie palaces, watching the first true mass medium. And the films watched were beginning to change telling longer stories through different deployment of formal elements than had been the case in 1908 or even 1912. A few years later; by 1917, the situation had changed yet were located in Hollywood, by now the centre not only of American film-making but of world film-making, largely as a result of the First World War disruption of the European industries. Hollywood production and distribution films themselves had grown one reel to an average length of sixty to ninety minutes, as film-makers mastered the demands of constructing lengthier narratives and codified into standard practices the formal conventions experimented with during the transitional years . they they again. from

The industry called these lengthier films 'features" adopting the vaudeville term referring to a programme's main attraction were descended from the multiple reel films produced by the members of the Motion Picture Patents Company and the independents during the transitional period, as well as foreign imports. Although film historians have characterized the MPPC's business practices as somewhat retrograde \_ the honour of producing the first multi-reeler goes to Trust the biblical blockbuster The Life of Moses; a fivereel film depicting the story ofthe Hebrew leader from his adoption by the Pharaoh's daughter to his death on Mount Sinai. Vitagraph continued to produce multi-reelers , and the other studios adopted the policy. Biograph, for example; released the two-reel Civil War story His Trust and His Trust Fulfilled, in 1911. Clearly, then, elements within the American film industry had begun to chafe at the 1,000foot or fifteen-minute limit, finding it increasingly impossible to tell a story within these constraints. They from

Existing distribution and exhibition practices, however; militated conversion to the multi-reel film. The limited seating of most nickelodeons dictated short pro grammes featuring a variety of subjects in order to ensure rapid audience turnover and a The studios , therefore, treated each reel of the releasing them to the exchanges according to the agreed except in one reel in any specific programme charging the same admission price as they did for all their other films impetus for the transition to the feature film came from the European, and specifically Italian, films imported into the country. Multi-reel foreign imports were distributed outside the control of the Trust and the independents, with rental prices keyed to both negative costs and boxoffice receipts. Instead of playing the nickelodeons , these features were 'roadshowed as theatrical attraction, shown in legitimate theatres and opera-houses. against profit.

Prior to the film's January 1915 release; huge cast, and historical accuracy, creating great public anticipation the famous director's most ambitious project. Griffith exercised as much care with the film's exhibition. Premièred in the largest movie palaces in Los Angeles and New York, The Birth of a Nation was the first American film to be released with its own score, played by forty-piece orchestra. The admission price of $2, the same as that charged for Broadway plays, ensured that the film would be taken seriously; and it was widely advertised and reviewed in the general press rather than the film trade press. All these factors showed that film had come of age as a legitimate mass medium. Of course, the film attracted attention for other reasons as well, its rep rehensible racism eliciting outrage from the AfricanAmerican community and their supporters, and offering medium could have for

Griffith's own multi-reel biblical  spectacular; Judith   of Bethulia (1913), which was made against the wishes of a Biograph front office still committed to the one-reel film. But Griffith's own historical costume drama epic, The Birth of a Nation (1915), excelled all previous features in length and spectacle, while dealing   with truly American subject; the Civil War and Reconstruction. It was this film

Films from other countries, such as Queen   Elizabeth (Louis Mercanton, 1912) played part in establishing feature films as the norm but it was the spectacular suaded the American industry to compete with longer films ofits own. In 1911 three Italian productions, the five reel Dante's Inferno (Milano Films, 1909), the two-reel Fall of Troy (1910, Giovanni Pastrone) and the four-reel The Crusaders   or Jerusalem Delivered (1911), treated American audiences to pictorial splendour seldom seen in domestic productions-elaborate sets and huge casts enhanced Released in the United States in the spring of 1913, the nine-reel Quo vadis? (Enrico Guazzoni, Cines, 1913), running for more than two hours and exhibited exclusively in legitimate theatres, really sparked the craze for the spectacular feature film. Adapted the a chariot race, and real lions, as well as clever lighting and detailed set design. The 1914 Cabiria (Giovanni Pastrone; Italia) capped the trend. The twelve-reel depiction of the Second Punic War contained such visually stunning scenes as the burning of the Roman fleet and Hannibal's crossing Pastrone enhanced the film's spectacle through extended tracking shots (unusual at this time) that created a sense of depth through set design. per-

The narrative structures , character construction, and editing patterns of the first multi-reel films, both American and Italian, strongly resembled those of the one-reel films of the time. This was particularly apparent in terms of narrative structure: one-reelers tended to follow pattern of an elaborated single incident or plot device intensifying toward a climax near the end of the reel. The first multi-reel American films , intended to stand on their own, adopted this structure but, even after distribution channels became available, longer films often continued to appear more like several one-reelers strung together than the lengthy integrated narratives that we are accustomed to today. However, film-makers quickly realized that the feature film was not simply longer version of the one-reel film, but a new narrative form, demanding new methods of organization, and learned to construct appropriate narratives, characters, and editing pat-terns\_ As had in 1908, producers turned to the theatre and novels for inspiration, not only in terms of structures. Feature films, therefore began to include more a main story. Instead of one climax Or series of equally intense climaxes , features began to be constructed around several minor climaxes and then a dénouement that resolved all the narrative themes. The Birth of Nation provides an extreme example of this structure its (in)famous lastminute rescue, as the Ku-Klux-Klan rides to secure Aryan supremacy, capping several reels of crisis (the death of 'Little Sister' , the capture of Gus, and so forth) and resolving the fates of all the important characters . they again they

difference being that character motivation and the number of important characters increased. Films now had the space to flesh out their characters, endowing them with traits that would drive the narrative action Often entire scenes served the sole purpose of acquainting the audience with the characters' personalities. The Birth of a Nation devotes its first fifteen minutes or so, before the outbreak of the Civil War occurs, to introducing its major characters, seeking to engender audience identifcation with the Southern slave-holding family; the Camerons. In tolerant natures, we see the pater familias surrounded by puppies and kittens and his son shaking hands with a slave who has just danced for Northern visitors. Ben

The transition to features served to codify many of the devices that film-makers had experimented with during the transitional  period. This is particularly related to moves to createa unified spatio-temporal orientation. Ana: lytical   editing became more common as film-makers sought to highlight narratively important details.

Around the year 1910 a number of film companies business in and around the small suburb of Hollywood to the west of Los Angeles. Within a decade, the system they created came to dominate the cinema not only in the United States but throughout the world. By concentrating production into vast factory-like studios, and by vertically integrating all aspects of the business, from production to publicity to distribution to exhibition, they created a model system-the 'studio system'-which other countries had to imitate in order to compete But attempts at imitand by 1925 it was the 'Hollywood' system, rather than the studio system as such, which dominated the market Sweden By that time, Hollywood had not only seized control of the majority ofworld markets but had made its products and its stars, such as Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, the most famous cultural icons in the world set

Throughout the period ofits inexorable rise, Hollywood fashioned the tools of modern business, from economics of scale to vertical integration, to give it the edge over all possible competitors. It developed costeffective methods of production, extended the market its product to cover the entire globe, and ensured the flow of films from theaother countries as well. European nations tried various protectionist measures , such as special taxes , tariffs quotas , and even boycotts, to keep Hollywood's domination at but to no avail.

## THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM

During the late 1910s and early 1920s, the successful com panies; led by Adolph Zukor's Famous Players-Lasky corporation, developed system by which to manufacture popular films on large scale. This system was much admired abroad, and film industries the world over sent their representatives over to Hollywood to study and, if possible, copy it. As well as visitors from France, Germany, and Britain, Hollywood was to play host in the 1930s to to Boris Shumyatsky; Stalin's henchman in charge of the industry in the Soviet Union.

The centrepiece ofthe productoffered by the Hollywood companies was the feature film, generally about ninety minutes Ten-minute newsreels or animated subjects might provide a complement, but it was the feature that sold theshow. The feature film had to be a story ofunusual interest, produced at a cost of about $100,000, sometimes from Europe. Through the 1910s foreign features repeatedly demonstrated that longer films could draw sizeable audiences The then independents imported epics from European film-makers who did not care to book through the Trust. The success of prestigious Italian productions existed suchas Dante's Inferno (1911) not only proved there market for longer fare, but helped to give the new medium long

In 1911 Dante's   Inferno   enjoyed successful extended engagements in New York and Boston. Where the average two-reel may have  played two Dante's Inferno was held over for two weeks. Where the average was shown in 2o0-seat 'odeon for 10 cents , Dante's Inferno was presented in imate theatres for $1.Indeed, the most influential ofearly feature films, D W.

United Artists achieved great success with, for example: The Robin Hood (1923, studio did not regularly release enough star-laden films Theatre owners called for three Chaplin, Fairbanks, and Pickford films per year, but the company was able to deliver only one every  twenty-four months. Theatre owners could not afford to go dark to wait for biennial long run, United Artists simply became a haven for inde pendent producers (some good, some bad) fleeing the strict confines of the major Hollywood studios. from

Hollywood centred its promotional efforts on the star system. Publicists had to acquire the art of manipulating the new techniques of mass advertising and mass communication to create something special in the minds of the growing middle class public. Stars provided an effective means of differentiating feature films; making each individual title an unmissable attraction. In 1909, for example, Carl Laemmle lured Florence Lawrence resenting his Independent Motion Picture Company (later Universal) . Laemmle then sent his star on tour and planted story after story in the newspapers, including one falsely reporting her death from

Others plucked their stars from the legitimate stage. Adolph Zukor's pioneering company Famous Players (later Paramount) whose slogan was 'Famous Players in Famous Plays' achieved early successes with The Count of Monte Cristo (1912) starring James 0'Neill, The Prisoner of Zenda (1913) starring James Hackett, Queen Elizabeth (1912) starring Sarah Bernhardt, and of the D'Urbervilles starring Minnie Maddern Fiske

Zukor soon saw the need to develop his own stars, not simply up already established names . Pickford saw her salary increase week in 1909 to 510,000 per week in 1917 as Zukor made her the biggest star of her day. Zukor's rivals developed their own 'Little Marys' , and 'inked' them to exclusive; long-run contracts. The Hollywood companies then fashioned elaborately prepared scenarios as centrepieces their stars But the stars were quick to realize that, if were so important to the studios; they had bargaining power of their own. Although many remained tied to exploitative contracts some of the most successful broke loose from the system On 15 January 1919, major luminaries Charlie Chaplin\_ Douglas Fairbanks, and Pickford joined with director D W. Griffith to create United Artists, and issued declaration of independence from their former studio bosses . United Artists announced it would distribute starbuy Mary from for they Mary

In the before the feature there had been two standard methods of production. For 'reality' subjects, a camera operator would journey to the subject, record the action, and then edit it together. For films inspired by vaudeville acts or taken from literary sources, movie companies employed a director to stage 'scenes and a camera operator to record them. Gradually during the 1910s, as the demand for narrative films increased, specialists were trained to assist the director to make movies faster. Writers thought up story lines , scenic artists   painted backgrounds, and designers fashioned appropriate costumes. days film,

United Artists was an anomaly The standard Hollywood system of feature film-making sought to guarantee the shipment of attractive films to theatres on a weekly basis , duction methods to produce films that filled theatres  This factory system would prove the best method by which to provide a regular supply of films .

Soon film-makers realized that it was less expensive to shoot the story out of order; rather than chronologically record it as it might be staged in a theatre Once all planned scenes were filmed, an editor could reassemble them, following the dictates of the script.All this required minimum cost in advance. Such a plan became known as the shooting script.

which would turn out to be popular at the box-office\_ Gradually as feature films became longer; stories became more more complex   shooting scripts. Paying careful attention to script preparation meant faster and cheaper feature film-making. One could make a careful estimate of the necessary footage for each scene; and film-makers developed techniques to minimize

The typical script immediately proclaimed its genre (comedy or drama, for example) listed the cast of characters , and sketched synopsis of the story, and only then went on to scene-by-scene scenario. From this plan, the head ofthe film company could decide whether he wanted to make the movie. The producer could, once the project was approved by the studio boss, redo the shooting script to fashion the actual order of production.

Studio bosses planned programme of films a year in advance. Sets were efficiently used over and over and adapted for different stories. Art directors designed and constructed sets; casting directors found the talent; make-up artists perfected the glamorous movie look; and cinematographers were picked to shoot scripts as written. again

The Hollywood production system was not invented, but evolved in response to a number of felt imperatives, of which the most important was the need for regular and consistent profit. A pioneering role, however, can be ascribed to producer Thomas Ince, working at Mutual in 1913. The standard studio working procedure, as devised by Ince, involved studio boss, the film's director, and continuity script. Once Ince as head producer had approved project; he assigned available buildings for filming; and commissioned writers and production artists to create the necessary script, sets, and costumes. Back-up systems , such as an internal  police force to keep out crowds, or fire-fighters to assist when wooden sets burned , meant that by the early 1920s studio lots, covering many acres , operated as veritable subcities within the urban environs of Los Angeles.

Time was of the essence, s0 actors were shuttled from Often multiple cameras were used for comAnd always present was the continuity clerk, who checked that, when shooting was completed , the film could be easily reassembled.

## DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL OF THE MARKET

lf Ince pioneered this   Hollywood studio 'factory pro duction system, it was Adolph Zukor who taught Hollywood how fully and properly to exploit it. By 1921 Zukor had fashioned the largest film company in the world-his producers and the distributor; Paramount, to form the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation. By 1917 his new company included stars such as Fairbanks Gloria Swanson, Pauline Frederick; and Blanche Sweet. Two years later; about the time Pickford and Fairbanks left to form United Artists, a quarter of the cinemas in the USA were regularly presenting Famous Players films.

Famous Players began to block book its yearly output of 50 to 100 feature films, which meant that the theatre owner who sought to show the films of Pickford had Mary

Hollywood may have been over 2,000 miles from New York City, but to crucial financing not available from conservative west coast bankers , Zukor showed the industry that eastern money was there to be tapped large from gain

During the 1920s Famous Players became high-flyer on the New York Stock Exchange. Others soon followed. Marcus Loew put together Metro Goldwyn-Mayer. William Fox expanded his film company as did Carl Laemmle with his Universal Studios. Even stalwart independents United Artists built a theatre chain Thus handful of major, vertically integrated companies came to dominate and define Hollywood\_

It was not enough, however; that this small handful of companies controlled all the movie stars and theatres sought to expand their markets   beyond the US border, to establish distribution all over the world\_ The crucial opening. While other national cinemas were constrained the leading  Hollywood companies moved to make the world their marketplace. Although the average cost for Hollywood features of the rarely ranged beyond $500,000, expanding distribution across the globe meant revenues regularly topped $1,000,000. Adolph Zukor; ever aggressive, led the way with series of spectacular foreign deals, and was able during the years prior to the coming of sound to They day

To maintain conditions for maximizing profits abroad the major Hollywood companies formed an association the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association of America (MPPDA), and hired former Postmaster-General Will H.

Germany also retained some degree ofautonomy though even this began to be undermined by away many leading German artists, and striking deals with the major German company, Ufa.

In an attempt to limit Hollywood penetration, a number ofnations enacted governmental protection for their film industries. The Germans, followed by the French, devised the 'contingent system whereby Hollywood imports were restricted to a certain number per year. The British quota system; set up in 1927, was designed to set aside a certain market, but it was framed in such a way that Hollywood companies were able to open up a production facility in Britain and make films that would qualify as 'British'

## THE PICTURE PALACE

The production and distribution of films constituted only two of the three essential pegs of institutional Hollywood power. Movie moguls knew that money came through the theatrical boxoffice and thus sought some measure of control over exhibition, the third crucial sector of the film business. If 'Hollywood" was initially a group of California studios and offices for distribution throughout the world, it also came to include a cluster of movie palaces situated on main streets from New York to Los Angeles, Chicago to Dallas, and, within a short time, London and Paris as well.

The modern movie palace era commenced in 1914 with Samuel 'Roxy' Rothapfel's openingofthe 3,OOO-seat Strand in 1914in York. combined a live vaudeville show with movies. His vaudeville something extra that attracted audiences away from more ordinary street. Roxy's shows opened with a house orchestra of fifty musicians playing the national anthem.

Balaban & Katz's success began when their Central Park Theatre opened in October This mighty picture palace became an immediate success, and Sam Katz, as corporate planner and president, put together a syndicate of backers who had all been wildly successful with their own Chicagobased businesses: Julius Rosenwald, head of Sears-Roebuck; the chewing-gum magnate; and John Hertz, Chicago's taxi and later innovator of the rental car network With this support, Balaban & Katz expanded rapidly, leading the nascent movie exhibition business from marginal leisure-time industry to centre stage in the economy of entertainment. king

The architecture movie  palace insulated public from the outside world and provided an opulent stage for the entertainment. The Chicago architectural firm headed by the brothers  George and W. designed the new-style theatres by   mixing design elements locales, among them classic French and Spanish designs came to expect triumphal arches, monumental staircases , and grand, column-lined lobbies (inspired by the Hall of Rapp from

Mirrors in Versailles) Façades were equally dramatic. Strong vertical lines were accentuated by ascending pilasters , windows, and towers, sweeping high above the tiny adjacent shop-fronts. The actual theatre building was made from rigid, steel shell, on which plaster-made decorations hung in brilliant purples, golds, azures, and trusses supported thousands of people in one or two balconies.

Once inside, patrons weaved through series of vestibules, foyers, lobbies, lounges, promenades; and waiting rooms designed to impress and excite The lobbies and foyers were, if anything; more spectacular than the archiDecorations included opulent chandeliers, classical drapery on walls and entrances , luxurious chairs and fountains, and grand spaces for piano or organ accompaniment for waiting crowds. And since there always seemed to be queue, keeping newly arriving customers happy was as important as entertaining those already seated. Inside the auditorium; everyone hada perfect viewofthe screen, andcareful acoustical planning ensured the orchestral accompaniment to the silent films could be heard even in the furthest reaches of the balcony.

Outside, colossal electric signs could be seen for miles. The upright signs towered several storeys high, flashing forth their messages in several colours. Behind them, stained-glass windows reflected the lights into the lobby, evoking an ecclesiastical   atmosphere and linking the theatre to the traditional, respected institutional architecture of the past.

One commentator compared these Balaban & Katz theatres to baronial halls or grand hotels in which one might have tea or attend ball. Balaban & Katz sought to make its upwardly mobile patrons feel as if they had come home to the haunts of a modern business tycoon

Balaban & Katz offered free child care, rooms for smoking; and picture galleries in the foyers and lobbies. In the basement ofeach movie palace a complete playground included slides, sand-pits, and other objects of fun for younger children left in the care of nurses while their parents upstairs enjoyed the show

The Balaban & Katz stage shows outdid even Roxy by developing local talent into 'stars' to equal Mary Pickford or Charlie Chaplin. The shows were elaborate mini-musicals with spectacular   settings   and intricate lighting

There had been crude experiments with blowing air across blocks of ice; but prior to Balaban & Katz's Central Park Theatre most movie houses simply closed during the summer or opened to tiny crowds.

Even when the war disrupted film industries and closed all but domestic across western Europe, to expand their foreign sales: rather than dealing directly with the majority oftheir foreign customers, they allowed most of their overseas business to be conducted by foreign sales agents who   re-exported American movies from London to destinations around the world.

Between 1916 and 1918 the extent of the American industry's representation overseas increased markedly. Some companies preferred to sign agents overseas to act to handle foreign distribution. Universal, which had established distribution facilities in Europe before the initiated new branches in the Far East, while Fox estab lished a combination of agencies and branches in Europe \_ South America, and Australia. Famous Players-Lasky and Goldwyn both worked through agencies in South Africa \_ South America, Australia, Scandinavia, Central America, and Europe. While these patterns of expansion involved a measure of it is notable that between them these four companies managed to encircle virtually the entire  globe with regional networks.

With the formerly powerful industries of France and Italy greatly reduced; the American companies found themselves in an unaccustomed position ofinternational supremacy.

Throughout the silent period the American industry received assistance in its operations from the Departments of State and Commerce. US consular offices cooperated in gathering a wealth of information relevant to motion picture trade, including audience preferences \_ conditions affecting exhibition; and activities of competitors. In 1927 Will Hays, president of the industry's trade association (the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America), successfully lobbied Congress for the establishment of a Motion Picture Department within the Department of on the grounds that movies acted as 'silent salesmen of American to audiences world-wide.

## PROTECTIONISM

advertising may have won it friends amongst popular audiences and the US Congress; it also stirred up opposition product amongst foreign governments. In 1927 the British government expressed concern that only while the vast majority were American, reflecting American values and showcasing American   goods. liamentary inquiry concluded that the Empire would be better served by films reflecting values and products of an Imperial stamp. Arguments about the cultural influence of Hollywood were part of pervasive discourse of antiAmericanism among European cultural élites. Bourgeois cultural nationalists feared the homogenizing influence of American mass culture, in which previously clear rep resentations of class and nationality; such as costume and gesture, became increasingly undifferentiated. Ironically, the pervasiveness of Hollywood itself served as an impetus behind government initiatives to support film-making in Britain, as was Quite apart from ideological issues, large profts were at stake in box office revenues: Britain constituted the most lucrative market in the world outside the United States, generating $165 million at the box office in 1927. Its own level of film production in that year stood at forty-four features (4.85 per cent of films shown) compared to the 723 (81 per cent) that were imported from the USA. In France, the proportion of domestically produced product exhibited was 74 French features shown (12.7 per cent) compared with 368 American imports (63.3 per cent) being

The only  European nation in which domestic pro duction exceeded imports in the late 1920s was Germany. Commercial flm production had begun to develop in Germany from about 1911, but it was not conspicuous amongst early European producers. During the World War the country's isolation from French, British, Italian, and American sources of film supply encouraged domestic production. With an eye to both the entertainment and values of the medium, the German local about the formation ofthe combine Universum-Film Aktiengesellschaft, or Ufa, which was secretly funded by the State In addition to its included a state ofthe-art complex that was constructed in 1921 at Neubabelsberg near Potsdam) it also served as a distributor, handling the products of other German large

studios in addition to its output. In the 1920s it continued to make  capital  acquisitions, including the unlike France, which by now concentrated mainly on prO duction for domestic consumption, Germany remained needed receipts from foreign markets to support its level of production. The number of features produced peaked at 646 in 1921 (compared to 854 produced by Hollywood in that year) , and thereafter declined to about 200 films a OI of the decade\_ year;

Germany was at the forefront of initiatives that were designed to counter Hollywood's hegemony in Europe. In was on the increase, the government responded by insti'contingent' plan that was designed to limit the proportion of foreign films that were exhibited in the German domestic market. In effect, the new regulation stated that only as many films could be imported each year as were produced within Germany. In 1927 German studios produced a total of 241 features, which amounted to 46.3 per cent of the total number of films exhibited in that year: cent, with the remainder being drawn from variety of other foreign sources. The 'contingent' paved the way for many similar kinds of protective legislation by the filmproducing nations of Europe: Austria, Hungary, France, Britain, and Australia all introduced quota legislation of some kind in the late 1920s.The British Films Act of 1928, for example, specifed a gradualincrease in the proportion of domestically produced film to be distributed in the British market, beginning with 75 per cent in the first year. tuting

There were many difficulties inherent in making such regulations work smoothly; especially in countries where infrastructure for film-making was less advanced than it was in Germany. In trying to formulate appropriate protectionist measures, governments were forced to and cultural imperatives of production, distribution, exhibition; and consumption. Probably the most intransigent problem was that exhibitors in most countries favoured American movies, for obvious reasons: arrived like clockwork and   they made  profts. In every country duction. The culturally based protectionist arguments of producers therefore had to contend with weighty resistance from exhibitor lobbies which sought to retain unrestricted access to American material. Another problem was that quotas could result in the production of rapid, substandard films (often funded by national subsidiaries of Hollywood studios) designed simply to they

## BRITAIN AND THE EMPIRE

Australia, Canada, and New Zealand were hopeful that British quota legislation could lead to 'film-buying' group amongst the film-producing members of the British Empire, perhaps countering some of the advantages of America's exclusive home market. The requirement that Empire films should be afforded certain minimum amounts of screen time in Britain raised the possibility that countries throughout the Empire would benefit first through the exhibition of their films in the British Isles and secondly through their mutual distribution throughout the other countries of the Empire. however; this arrangement favoured the products of the relatively highly capitalized British industry; and did very little to boost production in other countries remained   overwhelmingly  dependent upon imported films \_ most of which were American. In 1927, originated in Hollywood, compared with 5 per cent from Britain and 8 per cent from other countries . In Canada the proportion of American product was even higher; possibly reaching over 98 per cent. Hollywood's Canadian business was integrated into the domestic US distribution network to the extent that American distributors typically classified Canadian revenue as domestic income. In India at least 80 per cent of films shown in the late 1920s were American, even though twenty-one studios manufactured (Although its narrow range of distribution restricted its later burgeoned, with production levels exceeding those of any other country; including the United States, from the 1970s on.)

Australia had the remarkable distinction of the world's leading importer of Hollywood film footage in 1922, 1926, 1927, and 1928. However; this does not imply that Australia was the American industry's most lucrative customer nation during those years. The relative importance of markets as generators of revenue for Hollywood's coffers depended upon a range of factors including population size, per capita income, distribution costs, and rates of foreign exchange. In the final analysis, Britain was always Hollywood's most important foreign market, generating approximately 30 per cent of foreign income in the late 1920s. In 1927 it was followed in importance by Australasia (15 per cent) France (8.5 per cent), Argentina and cent) Brazil (7 per cent) and Germany (5 per cent). being

## FILM EUROPE

The idea of countering America's dominance abroad through cooperative international action gained some currency in Europe in the 1920sThe socalled 'Film movement consisted of various European initiatives , carried out between 1924 and 1928, aimed at joint production and reciprocal  distribution of films in the a small scale was carried out all over Europe in the 1920s: for example, in 1924 feature films were made in Austria (30 films) Belgium (4), Denmark (9), Finland (4), Greece (1) , Hungary (9), the Netherlands (6) Norway (1) Poland (8), Romania (1), Spain (10), Sweden (16), and Switzerland (3). However; the major participants in Film Europe were the principal producers of western Europe: Germany (228) France (73), and Great Britain (33). The general idea was to create kind of cinematic Common Market by breaking down sales barriers to European movies within Europe, allowing larger base for production than any nation could manage individually. Ideally; the movement would give European producers dominance within their own region as prelude to into the wider global market. In 1924 an arrangement for mutual distribution between Ufa and the French company   Établissements Aubert raised hopes ventures would momentum, but other deals were slow to eventuate. In 1925 the solidarity of the movement was shaken when Ufa ran into financial difficulties and was bailed out by American studios; part of the settlement of the loan required that a specified number of films by Paramount and MGM be given exhibition while Ufa films were given reciprocal distribution in the United States. Production and distribution within Europe did increase at the expense of Hollywood as a result of the contingent' and quota arrangements of the late 1920s, but the change was never dramatic. As Thompson (1985) shows, France benefited least: when American imports fell in any of the participating countries the difference was made up mainly with German films, and a few from Britain push gather

In the autumn of 1915a Broadway actor named Douglas Fairbanks made bis frst appearance on the screen The Lamb (1915) was a smash hit. Audiences loved him in the role of Gerald, a rected by tapping his pioneer heritage through proper Western adventure. Soon Fairbanks was starring in one 'athletic comedy' standard formula for (1916) clever urban satire penned by scenarist Anita Loos and directed by John Emerson.

Itwas cleartocriücs and audiences that Fairbanks was bringing the same character into every film; but it left few complaining: he was virtually unrivalled in popularDuring the late 1910s, Fairbanks gained increasing control over his productions.

Like his hero Theodore Roosevelt, Fairbanks became a cultural icon of the 'strenuous life s0 touted in American discourse as the antidote urban life, and to feminine infuence. Fairbanks, however, drained this masculine ideal ofits bellicose quality and substituted a boyish charm. Audiences found him the perfect balance between Victorian gentility and modern vitality.

Since the whole industry was nationalized \_ profits earned at the boxoffice could be put straight back into Soviet film production The stream of imports was reduced to generated more revenue than imported products, and in the 1930s imports virtually ceased altogether.

Cinemas tended to show either Japanese or foreign products but not both, and the majority of theatres catered to the less expensive ocal product.

At the same time, foreign receipts were an integral part ofHollywood's economicstructure in the 1920s,and the studios therefore consciously tailored aspects of their output to the tastes of foreign consumers. The higher the budget ofthe movie the more comprehensively the foreign market needed to be taken into account. Smaller films did not have to be shown everywhere to make their money back, and consequently had to make fewer allowances for foreign sensibilities . The most obvious concession to foreign tastes in 'prestige' productions in the selection and promotion of stars with international drawing Foreign audiences often responded particularly warmly to their own compatriots when appeared in the full international context of the Hollywood industry When Hollywood producers 'poached' acting talent from other national industries it not their competitors, it also recruited the affections and loyalties of foreign poputracted to Hollywood studios include Charles Laughton, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, Charles Boyer, Robert Donat, Greta Garbo, and many others .

It was not just actors who were recruited from foreign industries, but also technical workers of all kinds, notably directors and cameramen It was logical business move for an industry that could afford it to up the best staff in the world. As tactic, there was capitalist elegance about it: only the strongest national industries could offer the training and experience that would make a technician attractive to Hollywood. Once the acquisition had been made not only American industry inherently strengthened but its most immediate competitors were proportionately weakened. The industry' s explanation for this policy was that it allowed producing companies to buy

For example, talked about 'drawing into the American art industry the talent of other nations in order to make it and this explanation is not wholly fatuous Whether Or not it was the original intention behind Hollywood's voracious programme of émigrés   (predominantly European) probably allowed more international sensibility to inform the production Whatever the reasons, Hollywood's  particular achievement was to design product that travelled well.

The British film industry, in contrast to the French experienced steady production decline well before the war, but, as Kristin Thompson out in her analysis of trade patterns (1985) England enjoyed strong distribution and re-export business. Wíth its large domestic exhibition market, the world's most developed shipping and sales network, system of dependent colonial and commonwealth trading partners, and until 1915 tarifffree imports, Britain served as the heart of pre-war international export. On the eve of the war, however; although England had traditionally   provided the USA's   largest export market (with Germany a distant second) elaborate French and Italian productions successfully competed for an increased share of the business. This momentary deviation would more than be rectified as the USA went on to command the allegiance of wartime British viewers as never before\_ points

The events of the summer of 1914 and growth of the US studio system would profoundly alter the character of the British industry. The disruption of Continental markets (the loss of Germany to British trade, for example) diffiand reallocation of cargo space to war-essential materials, and an import duty on films, all proved disastrous to an industry predicated upon distribution and re-export.

Prior to the war; with the exception of Vitagraph, American Trust members had been content to carry on the vast majority of their trade with England, which in turn re-exported US films to Continental and world-wide markets. Thompson credits the examples set by the international marketing which required country-by-country negotiations; with wider change in US industry practice.

The war; regardless ofits impact on the various national cinemas, encouraged series of common developments. Film played an explicit role in shaping sentiments informing the public of the public

The experience of the Russian film industry until the government's collapse in 1917 appeared somewhat closer to the German than the Allied model. With a pre-war dependence on imports for up to 90 per cent of its films, war-related transportation problems, and declining production levels among its French, British, and Italian trading partners, the Russian industry had to fend for itself. Toeplitz (1987) claims that by 1916, despite difficult economic conditions, domestic production levels reached some 500 films. Under these circumstances, the Russian market, characterized by among other its demands for films with tragic endings and high degree of formal stasis, helped to develop a distinctly national cinema as evident in revolution and the civil war which followed it, together with extreme tion in many parts of the nation, temporarily halted the progress of the film industry. things priva

Such demonstrations of civic responsibility helped to placate the film industry's lingering enemies the pre-war era-concerned teachers , and citizens who perceived motion pictures as a threat to established cultural values-and to reassure those progressive reformers who held high hopes for film as a medium with uplifting potentials. National governments and the military; too, took an active role in the production and often regulation of film. Germany' s BUFA (Bild- und Film Amt) the USA's Committee on Britain's Imperial War Office, and Service   Photographique et Ciné matographique de lArmée variously controlled photo training films, and commissioned propaganda films for the legitimizing strategies aside, tent cinemas on the front and warm theatres in European cities short of fuel drew new audiences to the motion ization and support provided by the German government from public.

The war, then, served not only to dismantle Europe's dominant pre-war industries; but, ironically; to construct tacit consensus regarding the national importance of cinema The latter underwent curious permutation which assisted the US penetration of markets such as England, France, and Italy; and meanwhile stimulated the distinctive national identities of the German and Russian cinemas.

America, by contrast, came out of the war with a massive and relatively healthy domestic market; and an aggressive and welloiled studio system.

## THE SILENT FILM

## Tricks and Animation

Contrary to popular belief; the history of animation did not begin with Walt Disney's sound film Steamboat Willie in 1928. Before then there was a industry; and a vast number of films-including nearly 100 of Disney's-which pre-dated the socalled classic studio period of the 1930s.

The general history of the animated film begins with of the century. As (Westerns, chase films, etc:) during 1906-10, there appeared at the same time films made all Or mostly by the animation technique. Since most movies were single reel, there was little programmatic difference between the animated gressed after around 1912, with only a handful of excep tions , animated films retained their one-reel or-less length. At the same time they began to be associated in the collective mind of producers and audiences with comic strips,  primarily because adapted already existing heroes from the popular printed media and 'signed' the films in the cartoonists = names, although the artists generally had no involvement in the production. Until the First World War; animation was national phenomenon, but after about 1915 the producers in the United States dominated the world Although there were many attempts at indigenous European production, the 1920s remained the dominion of Mutt and Jeff, Koko the Clown, Farmer Al Falfa, and Felix the Cat. Of all the ways in which the formation of the animated film paralleled assimilation of the 'star system' in the 1920s, during which animation studios created recurring protagonists who were analogous to human stars they

## DEFINITIONS

The animated film can be broadly defined as kind of a manner that, when photographed and projected sequentially on movie film, produces the illusion of controlled motion. In practice, however, definitions of what constitutes animation are inflected by a variety of technical, generic, thematic, and industrial considerations.

If we restrict our discussion to theatrical animated films, then 1898 is a possible starverify either claim, the animation technique might have been discovered independently by J. Stuart Blackton in the United States and by Arthur Melbourne Cooper in England. Each claimed to have been first to exploit an alternative way of the motion picture camera: manipulating objects in the field of vision and exposing only one a few frames at a time in order to mimic the illusion of motion created by ordinary cinematography In frames have been  exposed OI exposed with an indefinite interval; the illusion ofmotion nition of animation as constructing and shooting frame by frame is clearly inadequate. All movies are composed, exposed, and projected frame by frame (otherwise the image would be blurred) The defining technical factor seems to be in the intended effect to be produced on the screen. being

## Genre

It was not until about 1906 that the animated film became recognizable mode of production\_ Humorous Phases of Funny Faces (Blackton, 1906) depicted an artist's hand sketcaricatures which then their eyes and mouths\_ This was done by exposing couple of frames erasing the chalk drawing, redrawing it slightly modified, then exposing more frames. The impression was created that the drawings were an artist's drawmoving on their own, achieving independence from him. Gradually these conventions were consolidated into characteristic themes and iconography which set this kind of film-making apart Before about 1913, the items that were animated tended moved ching ings

proportion of drawings to objects increased until, after 1915, 'animated cartoons' that is, drawings (especially comic strips) were understood as constituting the genre.

## Themes and conventions

Should animation be defined by characteristic themes? Some commentators have identified 'creating the illusion of life as animation's essential metaphor. Another recurmotifis the representation of the animators (or their within the films. The confusion real world of the animator and the film audience is another persistent theme

Animated films can also be defined culturally. It is often imagined that animation is mainly at children, and indeed children have always been (and continue to be) a part of the audience for the cartoon film. But animation consists of more than cartoons, and it should not be forgotten that even the classic cartoon was made for general audiences, not juvenile large

audience alone. A cultural definition of animation would therefore need to take into account the kind of humour it represents but also its association (particularly in the early period) with magic and the supernatural, and its ability to function as repository of psychological pro cesses such as fantasy or infantile regression.

## Industry

Produced in specialized units (whether in studios or in artisanal workshops) animated films soon came to have a particular place in the film programme. The cartoon was the moment in the programme which foregrounded neither 'reality' (newsreel documentary) nor human drama (the feature)  but humour; slapstick spectacle and and fantastic events produced by drawings or puppets.

## PRECURSORS

In these trick films animation was basically\_a trick Like the sleight of hand in magic film; the animated footage in these short films was a way to thrill, amuse, and incite the curiosity of the spectators. As the novelty wore off, some producers-notably Blackton himself abandoned this kind of film. Others expanded and modified it, leading to the creation of the new autonomous film genre

Méliès himself apparently did not make extensive use James Stuart Blackton, one of the founders of the Vitagraph Company and maker of what is usually taken to be the first true animated cartoon, Humorous Phases of Funny Faces . In 1906-7, Blackton made half a dozen films which employed animated effects. His most influential was The Haunted Hotel (February 1907), which was Europe, primarily because of its closeup animation of tableware. Among film-makers profoundly influenced by Blackton's Vitagraph work were Segundo de Chomón of R Booth (England), and, in the United States, Edwin S. Porter at Edison and Billy Bitzer at Biograph.

## ARTISANS: COHL AND MCCAY

## INDUSTRIALIZATION: BRAY AND BARRÉ

Émile Cohl had been a caricaturist and comic strip artist before discovering cinema around the age of 50. From 1908 to 1910 he worked on at least seventy-five films for the Gaumont Company; contributing animated footage to rather obsessive artist, devised numerous animation procedures which remain fundamental, such as illuminated animation stands with vertically mounted electrically driven cameras, and charts for calculating movement duration and lens depth offield. He placed various media under the camera, including drawings, models; puppets, photographic cut-outs, sand, stamps, and assorted objects. What Cohl's films did not exhibit was traditional linear plot; instead his background as a graphic artist became a source for ever-changing scenes of fantastic drawings that metamorphosed into each other with irrational logic and obscure symbolism. Bizarre though seem apparently extremely popular. He worked for the Pathé and Éclair companies, the latter of which assigned him to its American branch in Fort Lee, New Jersey; in 1912 He adapted cartoon series based on George McManus's comic strip 'The Newlyweds and their Baby' . The success of these fourteen films inspired many other newspaper cartoonists to produce or commission animated versions they

From the popularity of 'The Newlyweds' , McCay's extravaThe problem was that the craft was so labour-intensive that the rental return was insufficient tooffset production some of the time consuming drawing, but this compro mised the graphic interest of the films.

John Randolph Bray invented a way to alleviate much of the retracing which the older methods required. A comic strip artist and fledgeling animator (having released one film in 1913) developed the use of transparent another animator; Earl Hurd, who already held patents on celluloid use, that he perfected what became called the cel system. This involved separating the moving from the static elements in the picture The background and other non-moving parts were drawn on paper sheet; moving figures were drawn in their proper sequential poses on the transparent cels These were laid over and photographed individually to obtain the illusion of a figure moving across stationary back ground. This process remained standard in the animation industry until the advent of xerography and computeraided design. and Hurd aggressively protected their Bray Bray

One interested graphic artist was Winsor unquestionably the most brilliant newspaper cartoonist of the a short untitled flm in which he animated some characters from his 'Little Nemo in Slumberland' strip. The drawings were meticulously retraced on cards, photographed by Vitagraph, and then the release was coloured by McCay frame by frame.

In addition to providing narrative integration for the animation; the prologue also vividly showed how to draw and photograph animated cartoons to all who watched-and there were many.

The Sullivan studio was based on Barré's model (Sullivan had worked at Barré's briefly; many of the animators came from there; Barré himself worked on Felix from 1926 to 1928).

## TRICKS AND ANIMATION

Felix became the first animated character to gain the attention of the cultural élite as well as huge popularity with audiences. He was the subject of praise from Gilbert Seldes, an American cultural historian, from Marcel Brion, member of the French Academy, and from other intellectuals; Paul Hindemith composed score for Felix film. Thanks to Sullivan's aggressive marketing, the character also became the most successful movie ancillicensed all kinds of consumer products .

But the cat's bubble burst at its height of popularity. The demise of the series can be traced to several factors: the coming of sound, competition from Mickey Mouse, and Sullivan's draining the organization of its capital (while Disney was channelling every cent back Despite Educational did not renew its contract and the series went steadily downhill. in)

In 1925 Sullivan arranged to distribute through the Educational Film Corporation. Its national network combined with the increasingly creative stories and superb draughtsmanship of the Felix studio to generate the richest period, both in picture quality and in revenue. The Felix craze became a world-wide phenomenon.

Despite foreign competition, there were two areas in which Europeans had the market to themselves: topical sketches and advertising. The British sketchers, notably Studdy, and Anson Dyer; entertained wartime audiences with their propaganda cartoons. Dyer went on to make some successful short cartoons in the early 1920s, includ Little Red Hood (1922), and would become an important producer in the 1930s.

## Comedy

In bare quarter of a century, the silent cinema created tradition of flm comedy as distinctive and as contained as the commedia dell'arte-from which, however remotely; it seemed to derive something of its character. self

The cinema arrived at the end of a century that had witnessed a rich flowering of popular comedy. Early in the century; both in Paris and in London, archaic theatrical regulations had forbidden spoken drama in certain theatres, and stimulus for the inspired mime of Baptiste Debureau at Les Funambules proletarian audiences of the great cities of Europe and America found their own theatre in music hall, variety; and vaudeville With these popular audiences, comedy When life was bad, laughter was comfort; when it was good, they wanted to enjoy themselves just the same. Famous comedy mime troupes of the music halls, like the Martinettis, the Ravels, the Hanlon-Lees, and Fred Karno's Speechless Comedians, can be seen as direct forerunners of one-reel slapstick films\_ edians, Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel .

The year 1907 brought revolution, when the Pathé Company launched series of comedies featuring the character Boireau played by the comedian André Deed (André Chapuis, born 1884). Deed was the cinema's first international  popularity his grotesque, infantile; comic character. From Méliès, with whom he probably worked as an actor; Deed learnt much about the craft of film-making, and particularly trick effects\_

When in 1909 Deed was wooed away from Pathé by the to take his place. This comedian, Max Linder; possessed an apparently inexhaustible comic invention, and was performer of exquisite skill. The most durable and prolific of Pathé's stable of comic stars was Charles Prince (born Charles Petit-demange Seigneur), who made nearly 600 films in the course often years, in the character ofRigadin. Other Pathé   comedians included Boucot (Jean-Louis Boucot) the Little Moritz, the stout Rosalie (Sarah Duhamel), Cazalis , and the comic detective Nick Winter (Léon Durac)

The Boireau and Max series proved an incomparable draw at the box office and Pathé's rivals strove to compete Gaumont  poached the comedian Romeo Bosetti from Pathé, and he directed a Romeo series and Calino series (starring Clément Migé) before returning to head Pathé's Bosetti's successor at Gaumont was Jean Durand, whose greatest innovation was to create a whole comic troupe, called Les Pouics, whose orgies of slapstick and destruction were particularly admired by the surrealists. Out of the group emerged Onésime (Ernest Bourbon) who

The Italian cinema developed a parallel but distinctive school of film comedy, which produced forty comic stars and more than 1,100 films in the six years between 1909 and 1914. At the start of this period Italian cinema was undergoing great industrial   expansion. Giovanni Pastrone,  energetically building the fortunes of the Itala Company,   recognized the commercial   success of the French comedies which were being imported into Italy and lured André Deed to his studio in Turin. Deed's new Italian character of Cretinetti proved as successful as Boireau, and the hundred or more films he made for Itala assured the company' s prosperity

Deed's transformation from Boireau to Cretinetti was not unusual in character names were regarded as the property of the that when comedian changed his allegiance, he had to find a new name. Moreover, every country where the flms were shown tended to rename the character. Glupishkin in Russia. In France, the former Boireau now became Gribouille, only to revert to his original name when he returned to Pathé in 1911, the change being formally acknowledged with the film Gribouille redevient

The success of the Cretinetti series launched a frantic competition between the companies to recruit comic stars wherever they could be found-in circuses, music halls , or the legitimate theatre. Pastrone launched the Coco series with the actor Pacifico Aquilano. At the rival Turin studio Ambrosio there were Ernesto Vaser as Frico, Gigetta Morano as Gigetta, and the Spanish Marcel Fabre French comedian E. Monthus as Fortunetti, shortly after discovered the greatest native comedian of the Cines

The films and their subjects were often repetitive, but at the rate of two or more a week. Characteristically; each film established and problem for the comedian. Every clown in turn would be boxer, a house-painter, a policeman, fireman, a firt; a hen-pecked husband, foibles of the day were all to the mill-motor-cars , aeroplanes, gramophones, the tango craze, suffragettes; cinema itself.

## AMERICAN COMEDIES AND MACK SENNETT

America had   lagged behind continental Europe in developing name comedians who could sustain regular of the type was John Bunny (1863-1915), a fat, man who had been a successful stage actor and producer before recognizing the potential of films, and offering himself to the Vitagraph Company.

The transformation and preeminence of American screen comedy, however, may be dated from the formation of the Keystone Comedy Studio under Mack Sennett, in 1912 Keystone was the comedy arm of the New York Motion Picture Company; whose other Hollywood studios

were 101 Bison, producing Thomas Ince's Westerns and historical films, and Reliance, specializing in dramas. Sennett was Irish-Canadian, an unsuccessful stage actor who in 1908 had been reduced to working in movies. He was fortunate to be recruited to the Biograph Studios, where his natural curiosity led him to observe and absorb the discoveries of Biograph's principal director D. W. Grif fith with Griffith's   revolutionary techniques, Sennett studied the comedies coming from France, and by 1910 had acquired enough skill to be appointed Biograph's principal comedy director; a post which led to his appointsome ofhis former Biograph collaborators including Fred Mace, Ford Sterling, and the beautiful and witty Mabel Normand Along

Sennett was uneducated, intelligent, and tough, with an instinctive sense of comedy. Because he was easily bored himself, he could tell what would hold the audience's attention and what would not. Having mastered film craft at Biograph, he passed on his lessons. The stone cameramen were dextrous in following the free adapted from Griffith's innovatory methods. Key-

Keystone stars and films derived from vaudeville, circus early twentieth century America. Keystone pictures depicted world of wide, dusty streets with one-storey surgeries and saloon bars. Theclowns inhabited a familiar rooms with iron cots and rickety wash-stands, bowler hats and wild beards, feathered hats and harem skirts, ModelTs and horses-and-buggies. Comedy at Keystone was a wild caricature of the ordinary joys and terrors of everyday life, and the guiding rule was to keep things moving, to allow the audience no pause breath or critical reflection Sennett stock company of outrageous gro fearless  acrobats including Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle-a fat man with great comedy style and dexteritycross-eyed Ben Turpin, walrus-whiskered Billy Bevan and Chester Conklin, giant Mack Swain, obese Fred Mace. Other comedians who emerged from the Keystone Studio included the future stars Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon, Charlie Chase, who became a notable director as Charles Parrott, Charles Murray; Slim Summerville, Hank Mann, Kennedy, Harry McCoy, Raymond Griffith, Louise Fazenda, Polly Moran, Minta Durfee, and Alice Davenport. At least two Keystone Kops, Eddie Sutherland and Edward Cline, as well as two Sennett gagmen, Malcolm St Clair and Frank later became notable comedy directors in their own right. for Edgar Capra,

were uncompromisingly anarchic. an era of determinedly materialistic values, the Sennett films celebrated orgiastic destruction of goods and possessions, of cars and authority and dignity were tumbled and ridiculed.

Sennett's success at Keystone   spurred many rival studios, some short-lived, to set up in comedy production. His most serious rival was Hal Roach, who teamed up with a fellow film extra, Harold Lloyd, to make a comedy series starring Lloyd as Willie Work, a imitation of Chaplin's Tramp. Subsequent collaborations fared better, and the creation of Lloyd's bespectacled character launched their careers to joint success. After the parting with was inspired to team had been working solo for years. Laurel and Hardy were to pass into universal mythology; the sublime partnership ofthe tiny; diffident, tearful Stan with the pompous, unwisely over-confident Ollie pale large,

Sennett 's greatest year was 1914, when his most famous the studio in a few months of phenomenal discovery, innovation; and comedy creation. When his one-year expired, Chaplin, recognizing his immense commercial value, asked for large raise on his $150 salary. Sennett, short-sightedly perhaps, was unwillthe Essanay Studios and contracts with Mutual and First National which gave him the increased independence of operation which he craved. Keystone survived the loss, but the Chaplin year had been the studio's apogee. Key-

The style of the Roach stars over the years-Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy, the troupe of childcomedians Our Gang, Thelma Todd and ZaSu Pitts, Charlie Chase, Will Rogers, Edgar Kennedy, Snub Pollard\_exemplify the difference between Roach and Sennett. The latter's films tended to frenetic action and slapstick. Roach preferred well-constructed stories and a more restrained realistic, and ultimately more sophisticated style of character   comedy. Harold Lloyd and Stan and Ollie are recognizably human, sharing the foibles, feelings; and anxieties of an audience which is also engaged in the permanent battle with the perilous uncertainties of the contemporary world.

## THE HEYDAY OF SILENT COMEDY

At least until 1913 the standard length of a film was one reel; multi-reel feature films were at first resisted in many quarters of the film trade\_ It was, then, a dramatic revolution when Sennett announced the first multi-reel comedy at the end of 1914. Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914) was   designed to star the famous comedienne Marie Dressler in an adaptation of one of her stage successes. Charlie Chaplin was cast as her leading man. Despite the

Harold Lloyd was exceptional among the silent film comedians since his background and training were not in vaudeville Stage-struck from youth, he had worked in

little stock companies before landing job as a S5-a-day extra at Universal Studios, where he met Hal Roach. Lloyd joined Sennett after the Willie Work films and agreement with Roach; but reunited to make a new series, with Lloyd as a hayseed, Lonesome Luke. The flms proved successful enough; but in 1917 Lloyd put on a of horn-rim glasses for film called Over the Fence (1917), and discovered a far better character which was to bring him lasting fame. The Harold character evolved through a series of shorts, and was fully formed by the time of his first feature A Sailor-Made (1921) Harold was always aspiring to be the all-American hero, social Or economic betterment that always motivates the plot of a Lloyd comedy probably represented a sincere moral belief: Lloyd was in real life the embodiment of his own success stories they pair Man boy, for

By the turn of intertitles usurped the function of the lecture-changes that eventually gave rise to the new terminology. The documen tradition preceded film and has continued into the era of television and video, thus being redefined in the light of technological innovations; as well as in the context of shifting social and cultural forces. tary

## ORIGINS

The use of projected images for documentary purposes can be traced back to the mid-seventeenth century; when the Jesuit Andreas Tacquet gave an illustrated lecture about missionary's trip to China. In the first decades of the nineteenth century; the magic lantern was often used to give audio-visual programmes on science (particularly

The ability to transfer photographic images on to glass and project them with the lantern was crucial leap forward in documentary practice. Lantern slide images not only achieved smaller and easier to produce. Frederick and in Philadelphia, achieved this result in 1849 and London in 1851.

These documentary-like illustrated lectures flourished in western Europe and North In the United States, several exhibitors toured the principal cities, giving series of four or five programmes which changed from year to year In the last three decades of the nineteenth century, many noteworthy documentary-like pro grammes were given by adventurers, archaeologists, and explorers . Programmes on the Arctic were particularly popular from 1865 onward, and often displayed an ethnographic bent. Lieutenant Robert Edwin Peary inter-

rupted his efforts to reach the North Pole by presenting travelogue-style lectures in the early and mid-1890s. Displaying 100 lantern slides in his 1896 lecture, Peary not only recounted his journey from Newfoundland to the Polar ice cap in heroic terms but offered an ethnographic study of the Inuit or 'Esquimaux'\_

Similar kinds of programme were offered in Europe. Magic lantern activities flourished particularly in Britain, where the colonial agenda was strong: Egypt was a favouras War in Egypt and the Soudan (1887) were big money-makers. Victorian audiences also savoured lantern shows featuring local towns and countryside unaffected by the industrial revolution, including several series of slides made by pho tographer George Washington Wilson (The Road to the Isles, 1885)

Illustrated lectures about seemingly   primitive, impoverished peoples in distant locales had their counterpart in lantern shows on the urban poor. In Britain prOgrammes such as Slum Life in our Great Cities (c. 1890) treated poverty in picturesque fashion, often attributing it to alcoholism.

By 1898, exhibitors in different countries had begun to integrate slides and films into full-length documentarylike programmes.

Many programmes on the Spanish-American staged or 'reenacted events as well as fictional vignettes, posing the problem of generic specificity that continues to this day. In England, Alfred John West produced a fulllength show of slides and films, West's Our (1898), which ran for many years and proved effective propaganda for the British Admiralty. Navy

This 'cinema of attractions' approach continued to be popular; but it rapidly began to be balanced by the efforts of exhibitors to sequence films of related subject-matter; in many instances  through an extended narrative.

## FROM 'ILLUSTRATED LECTURE To 'DOCUMENTARY

After the war, illustrated lectures continued to be wide spread, but many were eventually turned into straight documentaries with lecturer. Former President Theodore Roosevelt had given a slide film lecture, The Exploration of a Great River, in late 1914,

and in 1918 this material was given a more general release as Colonel Theodore Roosevelt's Expedition into the Wilds . Martin E. Johnson, who had begun his career giving illustrated lectures , released his documentary Among the Cannibal Isles F. Rothapfel's Tivoli Theater. Robert Flaherty had filmed the Inuit of northern Canada between 1914 and 1916 and sub sequently used this material in an illustrated lecture The Eskimo (1916). When the possibility of turning it into an intertitled documentary was lost when the negative went up in flames, Flaherty; with sponsorship from the French furriers Revillon Frères, returned to northern Canada and filmed Nanook of the North (1922).

The term 'illustrated lecture had obviously become an inadequate label for the many non-fiction films that were distributed and shown with intertitles rather than live narration But critics and film-makers initially applied being

the term 'documentary' to those programmes that displayed a marked cultural shift, rather than simply to all non-fiction programmes that embraced shift in production and representational practices The illustrated lecture typically took the western explorer or adventurer (who was often also the presenter standing by the screen) as its hero. Nanook of the North switched its centre of attention from the film-maker to Nanook and his Inuit family.

Confining the film-maker's voice to the intertitles and keeping him behind the camera made the film appear more 'objective' than earlier practices, even though the film-maker had, in fact, become more assertive in shaping his materials.

As with Simmel, lectics underscore the contradictions of life. The city allows unprecedented freedom and this freedom allows the noble substance common to all to come to the fore but the also requires specialization, which means 'death to the personality of the individual' On one hand there is the mass-suggested by shots of feet and the intercutting of soldiers and cattle. On the other there are the people who to assert their individuality by dressing in highly eccentric clothing.

For Vertov; The Man with the Movie Camera was the culmination of a decade of work in non-fiction film-making. He sought to build up group of trained film-makers, whom he referred to as the 'kinoks" Their films celebrated workers through hard labour, and even in the early Kino pravda (Cine-Truth, 1922-5) newsreels, subject matter and treatment reveal modernist aesthetic\_ Vertov's films grew more audacious and controversial as the decade prOgressed. In Stride, Soviet! (1926) work processes are shown in reverse and bread and other products are taken from bourgeois consumers and repossessed by those who made them.

radically new ethnographic impulse can be found in certain Soviet documentaries of this period. Turksib (Victor Turin, 1929) looks at lementary lives of people in Turkestan and Siberia as way to explain the need for a railroad linking these two parts of the Soviet Union The film then shows the planand building of the railway with a fnal exhortation to finish it more quickly. A similar narrative is evident in Sol Svanetii ('Salt for Svanetia' , 1930), based on an outline by Sergei Tretaykov and made by Mikhail Kalatozov in the Caucasus The film engages in kind of salvage anthro pology but not, as was the case for Flaherty; for purposes of romanticization. Religion; custom, and traditional power relations are shown to be oppressive, blocking even the simplest improvements in people's lives. Among their many problems, the people and animals of Svanetia suffer from a lack of salt. After depicting the problem, the film offers a solution: roads\_ The point was easy for relatively unsophisticated viewers to grasp, but the increasing pressures of Stalinism are palpable in the film's hysterical enthusiasm and its reductive solutions. Significantly; the Svanetians do not experience an awakening of reVolutionary consciousness-it is the State that recognizes the problem and determines the solution

Another genre to which the Soviets made important contributions was the historical documentary, genre that relied heavily on the compilation of previously shot footage. The most accomplished maker of compilation documentaries was Esfir Shub, a former editor of fiction films\_ sisted of three feature-length productions: The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty (Padeniye dinasti Romanovikh, 1927), which covered the period from 1912 to 1917; The Great Road (Veliky put, 1928),about the first ten years of the Revolution (1917 -

II i Lev 1928), made for the centennial of Tolstoy's birth and film the 1897-1912 era.

Non-fiction film-making of an overtly political nature also went on in the United States and western Europe after the First World Short films on strikes and related activities were made by unions and leftist political parties in many countries In the United The Passaic Textile Strike (1926), a short feature that combined documentary scenes with studio re enactments, while the American Federation of Labor produced Labor's Reward (1925).

In contrast to these breaks with pre-First World War non-fiction screen practices, the new documentary appeared late in Britain, and in a modest form-John Grierson's Drifters   (1929), fiftyeight-minute silent docufishing boat that drifts for herring, and the people who in the nets and the fish in barrels for market.

Nevertheless; Grierson relegated the people who did the actual work to his film's periphery, even as he synthesized the familiar narrative of a production process with modernist aesthetics.

Modern art and silent cinema were born simultaneously. In 1895 Cézanne's paintings were seen in for the also stimulated artists to the revolution in art that between 1907 and 1912, just as popular film was also entering a new phase of development.

As commercial cinema approached the condition of synaesthesia with the aid ofsound and toned Or tinted colour, echoing in popular form the 'total work of art' of Wagnerianism and art nouveau, modernism looked towards non-narrative directions in film form for

A second direction led artists to burlesque OI parody films which drew on the primitive narrative mainstream before (as many modernists believed) it was sullied by realism\_ the art movements which gave rise to them, with roles played by-among others-Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp, Erik 1924), and Eisenstein, Len Lye, and Hans Richter (Everyday; 1929). The ironic humour of modernism was expressed in such films (some now lost) as Vita Futurista (1916), its Russian counterGlumov's Diary (Eisenstein, 1923) and Mayakovsky's comicGuignol films, and such later elaborations of cultural slap-

The art cinema Or narrative avant-garde included such movements as German Expressionism, the Soviet montage school the French impressionists' Jean Epstein and Germaine Dulac; and independent directors such as Abel Gance, F. W. Murnau, and Carl Theodor Dreyer. Like the artist-film-makers, they resisted the commercial film in favour of a cultural cinema to equal the other arts in seriousness and depth. In the silent era, with few language barriers, these highly visual films had as international an audience as the Hollywood-led mainstream opposed. Film clubs from Paris to London and Berlin made up noncommercial screening circuit for films which were publicized in radical art journals (G, De stijl) and specialist magazines   (Close-Up, ference and festival screenings-pioneered by trade shows and expositions such as the 1929 'Film und Foto' in Stuttgart-also sometimes commissioned new imental films, and Fritz clips of Kipho (1925, promoting a 'kine-foto" fair) by the veteran cameraman Guido Seeber.

in 1916-17. These sequential experiments began as investigations of the links between musical and pictorial harmony, an analogy Eggeling pursued in collaboration 1918, leading to 1920. Eggeling died in 1925 shortly after completing his Diagonal Symphony, unique dissection of delicate and almost art deco tones and lines, its intuitive rationalism shaped by cubist art, Bergson's philosophy of duration, and Kandinsky's theory of synaesthesia. It was premièred in a famous November presentation (Berlin, 1925) Richter, Walter Ruttmann, Fernand Léger, René Clair, and Group

Artists' films were underpinned by the flourishing of futurist; constructivist; and dadaist groups between 1909 and the mid-1920s. This 'vortex use Ezra Pound's phrase, included the experiments in 'light-play' at the Bauhaus, Robert and Sonya Delaunay's orphic cubism' , Russian 'Rayonnisme' and the cubo-futurism of Severini and Kupka, and its Russian variants in the 'Lef' at least in part; rooted in the cubist revolution pioneered by Braque and Picasso from Cubism was an art of

Nevertheless cubism and cinema are clearly enough products of the same age and within a few years were mutually to influence each other: Eisenstein derived the concept of montage as much from cubist collage as from the flms of Griffith and Porter: At the same time, they in opposite  directions Modern art was trying to expunge the literary and visual values which cinema was equally eager to incorporate and exploit (partly to improve its respectability and partly to expand its very language) they face

## CUBISM

While cubism sought a pictorial equivalent for the newly discovered instability of vision, the cinema was moving rapidly in the opposite direction. Far from abandoning narrative; it was encoding it. The 'primitive' sketches of 1895-1905 films were succeeded by a new and more confidently realist handling of screen space and film Subject-matter was expanded, plot and motivation were clarifed through the fate of individuals. Most crucially; and in narrative cinema smoothed the traces of change in shot, angle of vision, action by the erasure effect of 'invisible editing' to construct a continuous, imaginary flow acting\_ and

These values were the basis of academic realism in paintfor example, which the early modernists had rejected:

Cubism heralded the broad modernism which welcomed technology and the mass age, and its openly hermetic aspects were tempered by combining   painterly purism with motifs from materials used by artisans. At the same time, cubism shared with later European modernism resistance to many cultural values embodied in its cinema, dominated then as now by Hollywood While painters and designers could be fairly relaxed in their use of Americana, because independent at this time of its direct influence, the films of the post-cubist avant-garde are noticeably anti-Hollywood in form, style, and duction.

The avant-garde films influenced by cubism therefore joined with the European art cinema and social documentary as of defence market domination by the USA, each attempting to construct a model of film culture outside the categories of entertainment and the codes of fiction. Despite frequent eulogies of American cinema, of which the surrealists became deliberately the most delirious readers (lamenting the growing power of illusionism as film 'improved') few surviving avant-garde films resemble these icons. Only slapstick, as in Entr'acte (1924), was directly copied from the American example, but this has its roots tangled with Méliès\_ points against

Fischinger alone pursued abstract animation throughout his career, which ended in the USA. Other German film-makers turned away from this genre after the mid1920s, partly because of economic pressure (there was minimal   industrial support for the non-commercial Richter as Filmstudie (1926), mixing abstract and figurative shots in which superimposed floating eyeballs act as metaphor for the viewer adrift in film space.

The major films of the surrealists turned away equally from the retinal vision of form in movement-explored variously by the French 'impressionists' , the towards a more optical and contestatory cinema.

Arguably its major film and certainly its most influential, this stray of Surrealism was in fact made before its young Spanish director joined the official movement\_ A razor slicing an eye acts as an emblem for the attack on normative vision and the comfort of the spectator whose surrogate screeneye is objective realism of the static, eye-level poetic-lyrical film is mocked by furiously dislocated and mismatched cuts which fracture space and time, postcubist montage style which questions the certainty of seeing. The film is punctuated by craftily inane intertitles to aim a further blow at the 'silent' cinema, mainstream OI avant-garde, by a reduction to absurdity.

For most of its history; avant-gardes have produced the two kinds of film-making discussed here; short, oblique films in the tradition ofMan Ray; and the abstract German films , which broadly set up different space viewing from narrative drama, in which stable perception is interaimed for. Chien andalou sets up another model, in which arouse the spectator's psychological participation in plot or scene while at the same time meaning, and closure; an image of the dissociated sensibility or 'double consciousness' praised by Surrealism in its critique of naturalism for acting

Two further French films expand this strategy; which era and the end of the first phase of avant-garde film-making before the rise of Hitler; Almost feature length, these films (privately funded by arts patron the Vicomte de Noailles as successive birthday presents to his wife) link Cocteau's lucid classicism to Both films ironize visual meaning in voice over or by intertitles (made on the cusp of the sound era, they use both spoken and written text) voice raspingly satirizes his Poet's

obsession with fame and death 'Those who smash statues should beware one'), paralleled in the opening of dor by an intertitle 'lecture' on scorpions and an attack on Ancient and modern Rome. Bunuel links the fall of the classical age to his main target, Christianity (as when Christ and the disciples are seen leaving chateau after Sadean orgy) The film itself celebrates 'mad love A text written by the surrealists and signed by Aragon, Breton, Dalí, Éluard, Peret, Tzara and others was issued at the first screening: Age d'or, 'uncorrupted by plausibility' , reveals the linked with the problem of capitalism'.

Unlike Buñuel's film; Cocteau 's is not overtly anti-theo cratic, but even so his Poet-hero encounters archaic art, magic and ritual, China, opium, and transvestism before dying in front of an indifferent stage audience while he plays cards. Cocteau's film finally affrms the redemptive classic tradition, but the dissolution of personal identity opposes the western fixation on stability and repetition, asserting that any modern classicism was minedly neo' .

## THE 19305

Experimental sound-tracks and minimal   synchronized speech in these films expanded the call for non-naturalistic sound cinema in Eisenstein's and Pudovkin's 1928 manifesto and explored by Vertov's Enthusiasm (1930). This direction was soon blocked by the popularity and realism of the commercial sound film. Rising costs of film-making and the limited circulation of avant-garde contributed to their decline The broadly leftist politics of the avant-garde-both surrealists and abstract constructivists had complex links to Communist and socialist organizationswere increasingly strained under two reciprocal policies which dominated the 1930s; the growth of German nationalism under Hitler from 1933 and the Popular Front opposition to Fascism which rose, under Moscow's lead, a few years later. The attack on 'excessive' art and the avant-garde in favour ofpopular 'realism were soon to close down the international co-operation which German-Soviet coproductions PisFishermen (1935) OI Richter's first feature Metall (abandoned in 1933 after the Nazi take-over) Radical Soviet film-makers as well as their 'cosmopolitan' allies abroad were forced into more normative directions\_

politicized film-makers recognized this themselves in the second international avant-garde conference held in Belgium in 1930. The first more famous congress in 1929 at La Sarraz, Switzerland, at which Balázs Moussinac, Montagu, Cavalcanti, Richter, and

Ruttmann were present, had endorsed the need for aesthetic and formal experiment as part of of the film tomorrow optimistic 1929 book affrmed. One year later the stress was put emphatically on political activism; Richter's social imperative: 'The age demands the documented fact, ' he claimed.

The first result of this was to shift avantgarde activity more directly into documentary. This genre, associated with political and social values, still encouraged experiment and was ripe for development of sound and image montage to construct new documentary did not use actors; the final barrier between the avant-garde and mainstream or art-house cinema.

photographer since the age of Camerawork and New York

In Europe, notably with John Grierson, Henri Storck, and Joris Ivens , new fusions between experimental film and factual cinema were pioneered. Grierson's attempt to equate corporate patronage with creative production led him most famously to the GPO, celebrated as an emblem of modern social communications in the Auden-Britten montage section of Night Mail (1936), which ends with Grierson's voice intoning a night-time hymn to Glasgow \_ 'let them dream their dreams

Alberto Cavalcanti and Len Lye were hired to open the documentary cinema to new ideas and techniques. Lye's uncompromising career as film-maker, almost always for state and business patrons, showed the survival of sponsored funding for the arts in Europe and the USA in the depression years. His cheap and cheerfully hand-made colour-experiments of the period treat their overt subjects (parcel deliveries in the wholly abstract A Colour Box (1935) early posting in Trade Tattoo (1937)) with a light touch; the films celebrate the pleasures of pure colour and rhythmic sound-picture montage. The loss of both Grierson and Lye to North America after the 1940s marked the of this period of collaboration. end

Dulac made both abstract films such as Étude cinégraphique sur une arabesque ('Cinematic study of a flouris the pioneering feminist work Smiling Madame Beudet (La Souriante Madame Beudet; 1923). These aspects of her work through rhythms and suggestive harmonies' . But Artaud opposed this vehemently, along with rep resentation itself. In his 'Theatre Artaud foresaw the tearing down of barriers between public and in 1927, he wanted 'pure images' whose meanings would emerge, free of verbal associations, 'from the very impact of the images themselves The impact must be violent, shock designed for the eyes, a shock founded, so to speak, on the very substance of the gaze' . For Dulac too, film is 'impact' , but typicallyits effect is 'ephemeral analogous to that provoked by musical harmonies' Dulac fluently explored film as dream state (expressed in the dissolving superimpositions in La Coquille) and so heralded the psychodrama film, but Artaud wanted film only to keep the dream state's most violent and shattering qualities, breaking the trance of vision. ings

Here, the avant-garde focused on the role of the spectator. In the abstract film, analogies were sought with nonnarrative arts to challenge cinema as dramatic form Jean Coudal's 1925 surrealist account, film viewing is seen as akin to 'conscious hallucination' in which the body undergoing 'temporary depersonalization'\_is robbed of We are nothing more than two eyes rivetted to ten meters of white screen, with fixed and This critique was taken further in Dalis 'Abstract of a Critical History of the Cinema' (1932) which argues that film's 'sensory base in rhythmic as 'the refined product of abstraction' , Or idealization, rooted in 'the rapid and continuous succession of film images; whose implicit neologism is directly proportional to specifically generalizing visual culture Countermanding this a traumatic and violent disequilibrium veering towards concrete

For these and other artists filmmaking was an additional activity to their work in other media.

Paradoxically; the assault on the eye (or on the visual order) can be traced back to the 'study of optics" which Cézanne had recommended to painters at the dawn of modernism. This was characteristically refined by Walter Benjaminin 1936,linking mass reproduction; the cinema, and art: 'By its transforming function, the camera intro duces us to unconscious optics as does psychoanalysis to unconscious impulses.

## WHY SERIALS?

The film industry turned to serials for number of reasons, aside from the ease of tapping into an already established popular market for sensational stories. It saw the commercial logic of adopting the practice of serialization, already mainstay of popular magazines and newspapers. With every episode culminating in penseful cliffhanger ending, flm serials encouraged steady volume of return customers, tantalized and eager for the fix of narrative closure withheld in the previous instalment.In this system ofdeliberately prolonged desire punctuated by fleeting, intermittent doses of satisfaction serials conveyed a certain acuityabout the new psychology of consumerism in modern capitalism.

Serials also made sense, from the studios' perspective because at least in their earliest years, they represented an attractive alternative for manufacturers who were incapable or unwilling to switch over to five- and six-reel feature films. Released one Or two reels at a time for dozen Or so instalments, serials could be pitched as 'big' titles without overly daunting the studios' still relatively modest production infrastructure and entrenched system short-reel 'variety' programme. Later; as real feature films with a short comedy and newsreel along

advertising relatively inefficient. As late as 1919, only about one theatre in hundred ran films for an entire out of five changed films daily. In this situation, serials allowed the industry to flex its exploitation muscle, since each serial stayed at theatre for three to four months. Serial producers invested extremely heavily in newspaper, magazine, trade journal billboard, and tram advertising, as urate the 'Hollywood' system ofpublicity in which studios more for advertising than for the production of the film itself.

The emergence of serials was linked to one form of publicity in particular. Until around 1917, virtually every was released in tandem with prose versions published simultaneously in newspapers and national magazines.

This practice exploded the scope of film publicity and paved the way for the cinema's graduation to a truly mass medium-

## THE FILMS AND THEIR FORMULAS, 1912-1920

Although series films (narratively complete but with continuing characters and milieu) had appeared as early as 1908,or earlier if one counts comedy series, the first serial film proper (with story-line connecting separate instalments) was Edison's What Happened to Mary; released in twelve   monthly 'chapters beginning in July 1912. Recounting the adventures ofa country girl (and, needless to say, unknowing heiress) as she discovers the pleasures and perils of bigcity life while eluding an evil uncle and sundry other villains\_ the story was published simultaneously (along with numerous stills from the screen version) in Ladies' World, major women's monthly magazine. Although critics derided the serial as mere melodrama of action and 'a lurid, overdrawn thriller it was at the box-office, making the actress playing Dangerfield , one of the cinema's first really big (if rather ephemeral) stars. The commercial success of What Happened to prompted the Selig Polyscope Company and the Chicago Tribune syndicate to team up in the production and promotion of Ihe Adventures of Kathlyn, exhibited and published fortnightly throughout the first half of 1914.In keeping with the early star system's trope of eponymous   protagonists, Kathlyn Williams   played popular Mary Mary Mary

## Louis Feuillade

Another constant in serial stories relates to the pivotal position of the heroine's father; along with the total nonexistence of any mother characters (and, for that matter; most other female figures as well) The heroine is always the daughter (often an adopted one) of a powerful man (rich industrialist; army general, fire chief, explorer, inventor; or newspaper mogul) who is assassinated by the villain in the first episode or (less frequently) abducted and black mailed. The serial hinges on the daughter's fight to her inheritance while the villain and sundry henchmen involves the daughter's fight to save her father from the clutches of the villain, redeem his tarnished name, or simply aid the father (independent of his supervision) in thwarting his, and the nation's, enemies gain

At least in part it reflected the growing rift, on many levels, between residual 'nickelodeon' cinema, geared toward small-time exhibitors and lower-class audiences , and an emergent Hollywood model of mass entertainment. It is also likely that many audiences simply tired of the serial's highly formulaic stories; dubiously thrilling thrills, and low production values polls

## INTERNATIONAL SERIES AND SERIALS

Although an international history of series and serials has yet to be written, series and serials were far from just an American   phenomenon. France's considerable investment in series and serials is well covered in Richard Abel's history of silent French cinema. Éclair pioneered roi des détectives (Nick Carter, of the detectives 1908), followed by Zigomar (1911) and various sequels, all directed by Victorin Jasset. Louis Feuillade directed a number of celebrated underworld crime serials for Gaumont: Fantômas (1913-14), Les   Vampires (The Vampires 1915-16), Judex (1917), and La Nouvelle Mission de Judex ('Judex's new mission' , 1918) being king

In Britain leading serials were, among others, The Adventures of Lieutenant Rose (1909), The Adventures of Lieutenant Daring (1911), The Exploits of Three-Fingered Kate (1912) Films Lloyds in Germany made the Detective Webb series (1914), which, like Feuillade's Fantômas, was comprised of featurelength instalments. In Russia, a few serials followed after the huge success ofimported American and French serials: Bauer's Irina Kirsanova, and Gardin and Protazanov's

The intertextual links also changed. Serials became much more closely associated with pre existing characters in the Sunday comics, comic books, radio; and pulp magazines In 1936 Universal bought the rights to many comic strips owned by the King Features Syndicate, and other studios made similar deals. Serials now fleshed out heroes like Flash Gordon, Superman, Captain Marvel, Dick Batman, Buck Rogers, The Phantom, Captain Tracy,

While these and other domestically produced serials made serials that caused the biggest sensation among with massive newspaper tieins, Les Mystères de New York (1916) (a repackaging of twenty-two episodes from The Exploits of Elaine and two sequels) was smash hit and began a trend in ciné-romans (or 'film-novels'). its

## THE 19205 AND AFTER

In the United States, film serials lived out the 1920s, and survived to the rise as low-budget 'B' product with limited distribution and an appeal primarily case from more obvious that serials were slapdash juvenile movies for 'Saturday afternoon at the Bijou' . With the phasing out of prose-version tieins in the 1910s, serials never enjoyed wide publicity and distribution Furthermore the disappearance of the classical blood-andthunder stage melodrama, and a generational shift that caused adult audiences to view overwrought sensational melodrama as ridiculous and old-fashioned rather than exhilarasolidified the serial's into cartoonish children's genre. The serial's essential formula (hero and heroine fight villain for possession of weenie) remained unchanged throughout, but the genre underwent some transformations The 'serial-queen faded away in the late 1910s and early 1920s as emphasis shifted toward the adventures of traditional beefy heroes like Elmo Lincoln (Elmo; the Mighty; 1919; Elmo; the Fearless, 1920; The Adventures of Tarzan, 1921), Eddie Polo (King of the Circus, 1920; Do or Die, 1921), and Charles Hutchinson (Hurricane Hutch, 1921; Go Get 'Em Hutch, 1922).

## PATHÉ-FRÈRES INDUSTRIALIZES THE CINEMA

tematically industrialized every sector of the new industry. Two years before, Pathé had pioneered a system of mass production (headed by Ferdinand Zecca) which soon had the company marketing at least half a dozen film titles per week (or 40,000 metres of positive film stock as 250 cameras, projectors, and other apparatuses per month By 1909, those figures had doubled across the board , and the Pathé studio camera and projector had become the standard industry models This production capacity enabled Pathé to construct one cinema after another in Paris and other cities, beginning in 1906-7, shifting film exhibition away from grounds to permanent sites in urban shopping and entercircuit of nearly 200 cinemas throughout France and Belgium, probably order better to regulate distribution of its product within that circuit, in 1907-8 the company also set up a network of six regional agencies to rent, rather than sell, its weekly programme of films. This network augmented the dozens of agencies Pathé had opened across the globe, beginning as early as 1904, and through which it quickly dominated the world-wide sale and rental of films. By 1907, one-third to one-half of the

films making up American nickelodeon programmes were Pathé's-as a general rule; the company shipped up to 200 copies of each film title to the United States. As the 'empire' of this first international cinema corporation began to stabilize (and eventually contract in the USA because of MPPC restrictions) and film distribution exhibition became its most secure sources of revenue Pathé gradually shifted to growing Frères had become kind of parent company (Charles Pathé himselfinvoked the ofa book publisher) to a and Comica) to Russia, Italy; Holland, and the USA. and analogy

The other French companies engaged in the cinema's expansion either followed Pathé's lead or found profitable niche in one or more sectors of the industry. Léon Gaumont's company; Pathé's closest rival was the only active in every sector; from manufacturing equipment to producing, distributing, and exhibiting films. Its 1911 renovation of the Gaumont-Palace (seating 3,400 people) for instance; not only anchored its own circuit of cinemas but spurred the construction of more 'palace' cinemas in Paris and elsewhere Unlike Pathé, however, Gaumont steadily increased direct investment in production so that it too could release at least half a dozen film titles per week. Under the management of Charles Jourjon and Marcel Vandal, Éclair operated within a slightly narrower sphere, having never established a circuit of cinemas to present its product. Instead; to fuel its aggressive expansion between 1910 and 1913, Éclair concentrated on producing and distributing films as well as manufacturing various kinds of apparatuses. with Pathé, it company with the capital and foresight to open its own production studio in the USA Most smaller French companies either confined their efforts to production (Film d'Art, Eclipse, and Lux) or concentrated on distribution (AGC). The most important independent distributor, Louis Aubert, embarked on somewhat   different trajectory much as Universal, Fox, and Paramount would slightly later in the USA. Aubert's company prospered through its exclusive contracts to release films by the major Italian and Danish producers in France, including Quo vadis?; by Along

1913 Aubert was reinvesting his profits in circuit of 'palace' cinemas in Paris as well as a new studio for pro ducing his own films.

Another instance of increasing standardization within the French cinema was the continuing series, a marketing strategy in which one film after another could be organized around a central character (identified by name) and single actor. As early as 1907, Pathé began releasing comic series entitled Boireau, named after recurring character played by André Deed. Boireau's success soon led to other comic series (especially after Deed left France to workin Italy as Cretinetti) In 1909 Gaumont introduced its Calino series, with Clément Migé often playing a bumcivil servant; the following year there was the Bébé series, with René two years later came the incredibly wacky Onésime series, with Ernest Bourbon, and Bout de with René Poyen as an even more threatening enfant terrible. As for Pathé itself, among the halfdozen comic series it regularly distributed, two stood out above the rest. One was Rigadin, starring Charles Prince as a parodic white-collar Don Juan; Le Nez de Rigadin (Rigadin's Nose' Dary; Zan,

What kinds of films dominated French cinema pro grammes during this period; and what specific titles could be singled out as significant? The actualités, trick films, once characterized the early 'cinema of attractions' had, by 1907, given way to more fully narrativized cinema, especially through Pathé's standardized production of comic chase films and what its catalogue advertised as 'dramatic and realist' films, often directed by Albert Capellani. The latter category covered domestic melodramas such as La Loi du 'The law of pardon' , 1906), in which families were threatened with dissolution and then securely reunited , and Grand Guignol variants such as Pour un collier! For necklacel' , 1907), in which the resolution was anything but secure Within such films there coalesced system of rep resentation and narration that relied not only on longtake tableaux (recorded by Pathé's 'trademark' waist-level bold red intertitles , inserted letters, and through camera movement, cut-in close shots, point-of view shots, and reverse-angle cutting as well as on various forms of repetition and alternation in editing. This system achieved remarkable effects in melodramas as diverse as fith remade in 1909 as The Lonely Villa) , and Homme aux gants blancs The man with white gloves' , 1908) as well as in comic films like Ruse de mari 1907) and Le Cheval emballé 'The wrapped-up horse' , 1908) In other words, Pathé films were deploying most of the elements so basic to the system of narrative continuity; all of which historians still often attribute to slightly later Vitagraph or Biograph films. pardon

Skilful, cleverly structured gags distinguish Linder's work from quinquina ('Quinine victim' , 1911) to Max pédicure ('Max the pedicure' 1914). So Éclair, Eclipse, and Lux all made them regular part of their weekly programmes.

Here, the trade press was unusually active (1905-9), edited by Pathé's collaborator; the Paris lawyer Edmond Benoît-Lévy, and Ciné-Journal (1908-14), edited by Georges Dureau. Yet these efforts at legitimization were most visible in the production of literary adaptations dArt and SCAGL, new companies with close ties to prestigious Paris theatres The earliest and best known of these was Film dArt's LAssassinat du Duc de Guise ('The assassination of the Duc de Guise' , 1908), whose deep space economical acting style (particularly that of Charles Le Bargy) and succinct editing had a considerable influence; at least in France. That influence can be seen, in conjunction with the system of narrative continuity earlier developed by teenth century plays and operas. Although most clearly evident in those dealing with an indigenous French history; such as SCAGLs La Mort du Duc dEnghien (The death of the Duc d'Enghien' , 1909) and Gaumont's Le 1909), it is also apparent in films as disparate as Film dArt's La Tosca (1909) and Werther (1910). Generally; those running counter to this pattern were 'oriental films such as Pathé's Cléopâtre and Sémiramis (both 1910), whose privileged moments of spectacle (accentuated by the company's trademark stencil colour) and 'exotic' characters served to reinforce the mandate for France's colonial empire Film

## THE GREAT WAR: COLLAPSE AND RECOVERY

The general mobilization orders in early August 1914 brought all activity in the French cinema industry to an abrupt halt. Until recently; it has been customary to use the war to explain the decline of the French vis-à-vis the American cinema industry  Although there is some truth to that claim, the French position had been weakening before the war began. By 1911, for instance, under pressure from MPPC restrictions and the 'independent' companies expansion, Pathés portion of the total released in the USA had dropped to less than 10 per cent. By the end of 1913,in both numbers of film titles and total footage in distribution, the French were ground to the Americans on their war simply accelerated process already well under way. and its most devasta effect, other than cutting off prOduction, was severely to restrict the export market on which the French companies so heavily depended for distributing their films losing ting

And many of those films were distributed by new companies; some with American backing.

Eclipse survived largely on the strength of its new film-making team, Mercanton and René Hervil. In spite of the odds, independent production companies actually increased in number, and some (those of André Hugon, Jacques de Baroncelli, and Germaine Dulac) even flourished\_ That could succeed under such conditions was due, in large part, to the relatively widespread distribution their whose circuit of cinemas continued to expand they

Despite contributing to the onslaught of American films , as well as losing critical personnel like Capellani and Linder to the USA, Pathé remained a major distributor of French product. Not only did the company support feature-length productions from SCAGL (Leprince; Monca) and Valetta (Morlhon) but itsought out new film-makers , also provided financial backing to Film d'Art, where Henri Pouctal was joined by young Abel Gance Gaumont, by contrast, had to cut back its production schedule, especially after Perret left to work in the USA.

Out of such melodramas developed the most advanced strategies of representation and narration in France, particularly in what Gance polemically called 'psychological' films. Some, like Gaumont's one-reel Têtes de femme, femmes de tête ('Women's heads, wise women' , 1916), directed by Jacques Feyder exclusively in close shots, nearly passed unnoticed. But others were celebrated by Émile Vuiland by Colette and Louis Delluc in a new weekly trade journal, The most important were Gance's own Le Droit à la vie ('The right to life' , 1916) and especially Mater Dolorosa (1917), both much indebted lighting, framing, and editing strategies; Mater Dolorosa seemed to revolutionize the stylistic conventions of the everyday objects, such fallen black veil, took on added significance through and associational editing. These strategies were shared by a related group of 'realist melodramas which Delluc saw as influenced by certain Triangle films but which also derived from an indigenous French tradition. Here, Antoine's adaptations of Le Coupable (1917) and Les Travailleurs de la mer ('Workers of the sea' , 1918) their location shooting (one on the outskirts of Paris, the other on the coast of Brittany). But Delluc also drew attention to the photogénie of the peasant landscapes in Baroncelli's Le Retour aux champs 1918), one of Eclair's last films. Both kinds of melodrama would provide the basis for some of the best French flms after the war. Temps

'LES ANNÉES FOLLES FRENCH CINEMA REVIVED

By the end of the war, the French cinema industry confronted a crisis aptly summed up by posters advertising Mundus-Film (distributors for Selig, Goldwyn, and First fired one film title after another into the centre ofa French target.

As Henri Diamant-Berger, the publisher of Le Film; bluntly put it, France was in danger of becoming a 'cinematographic colony' of the United States. How would the French cinema survive and, ifit did, Delluc asked, how

The industry's response to this crisis was decidedly mixed over the course of the next decade. The production sector underwent a paradoxical series of metamorphoses. The established companies, for instance, either chose or were forced to beat a retreat. In 1918 Pathé-Frères reorganized as Pathé Cinéma, which soon shut down SCAGL and sold offits foreign exchanges, including the American affiliate. Pathé Cinéma   responsible for   making andmarketing apparatuses and film stock and set up a new company, Pathé Consortium (over which Charles Pathé lost control) , which rashly began investing in big-budget 'superproductions= that soon resulted in staggering financial losses. After briefly   underwriting 'Séries Pax' films, Gaumont gradually withdrew from production, move that accelerated with Feuillade's death in 1925.Film d'Art also reduced its production schedule as its chief producers emergence of 'cottage industry' of small production companies during the early 1920s provided significant counter to this trend. Joining those film-makers already instance, were Perret (returning from the USA), DiamantLéon Poirier, Julien Duviwere established by Louis Nalpas, who left Film d'Art to bier; who left Gaumont to found Cinégraphic as an alternative atelier for himself and other independents, and Montreuil studio, first as Films Ermolieffand then as Films Albatros . The two other   principal   producers were the veteran Aubert and a newcomer, Jean Sapène.

Pathé, for instance, joined a new European consortium financed by the German Hugo Stinnes and the Russian émigré Vladimir Wengeroff   (Vengerov), which initially backed Gance's proposed six-part film of Napoléon and, through Ciné-France, managed by Noé Bloch (formerly of Albatros)  underwrote Fescourt's four-part adaptation of Les Misérables (1925) and Victor Tourjansky's Michel Strogoff (1926). That consortium collapsed, however, when Stinnes's sudden death exposed an incredible level of debt. Further French-German alliances were then curtailed by heavy American investment, through the Dawes Plan, in the German cinema industry. The results of this coproduction strategy were mixed. Although generally profitable such films   required huge  budgets which coupled with high rate of inflation in France, reduced the French level of production to just fifty-five films in 1925 drying up funds for small production companies and Fanny

At the same time, Robert Hurel, a French producer for Paramount, founded Franco-Film, wooing Perret away Natan after La Femme nue (The naked woman' , 1926) to deliver a string of hits starring Louise Lagrange, the new Princess of the French Cinema= Finally, out of the ashes of Ciné-France arose the Société Générale des Films , which drew on Grinieff's immense fortune to complete Gance's Napoléon (1927) and finance Alexandre Volkoff's Casanova (1927) and Carl Dreyer's La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc ('The Passion of Joan of Arc' , 1928) Against this tide of contenacious , but marginal, independence, among them Jean Epstein and especially Pierre Braunberger (the former publicity director for Paramount), whose Néo-Film offered 'laboratory' for young film-makers . from

During the 1920s the distribution sector ofthe industry faced an even more severe challenge. One after another; the major American companies either set up their own offices in Paris or strengthened their alliances with French distributors In 1920 came Paramount and Fox-Film; in 1921 it was the turn of United Artists and First National; in 1922 were   joined by Universal, Metro and Goldwyn, the latter two signing exclusive distribution icans' economic power but also to the French government's to impose substantial   import duties on American films or to legislate quota system restricting their numbers vis-à-vis French films. The American industry's failure to rebuild its own export markets lost in the than a dozen French films were exhibited annually from 1920 to 1925, and few reached cinemas outside New York. By the end of the decade the number had increased where percentage of French   production was distributed between 1923 and 1926, in contrast to the far fewer German flms imported into France. That too changed, however; when ACE began distributing German films in firms altogether. By 1927 the number of German in France they good

surpassed the total production of the French cinema industry.

That the French distribution market did not capitulate completely to the Americans and Germans was due in large part to Pathé Consortium. Whatever its internal it did before and during the the major outlet not only for its own product but also for that of smaller companies and independent producers. Cinéromans serials played decisive role precisely at the moment when, in 1922-3, fresh from their conquest of the British cinema market and just before their intervention in Germany, American companies seemed ready to impose a block-booking system of film distribution within France. According to Fescourt, the serials functioned as a counter system of block booking in that, for at least nine months, they guaranteed exhibitors 'a returns from faithful public hooked on the formula' . Having taken over the contracts of AGC and negotiated others with Film d'Art and independents such as Feyder and Baroncelli, by 1924-5 Aubert complemented Pathé efforts as the second largest French distributor. Yet, even though other companies emerged, such as Armor (to distribute Albatros films) there were independent French distributors nor was there consortium or network which could distribute the great number of independent French films\_ As the decade wore on, the French resistance to foreign domination began to weaken: Gaumont came under the control of MGM, while Aubert and Armor gradually moved within the orbit of ACE. However successful Pathé, Aubert, and others had been, the Americans and Germans secured a foothold within the French cinema industry at the crucial moment of the transition to sound films. long

Compared to the rest of the industry, the exhibition sector remained relatively secure throughout the 1920s. The number of cinemas rose from 1,444 at the end of the war to 2,400 just two years later and nearly doubled to 4,200 by 1929 At the same time, boxoffice receipts period of high inflation; going from 85 million francs in 1923 to 230 million in 1929. This occurred despite the fact that cinemas were inde pendently; even individually;   owned (the was perhaps as high as 80 per cent), few of those had a capacity basis. That the exhibition sector did so well was due partly to the enormous popularity of American films, from Robin Hood (with Douglas Fairbanks) to Ben-Hur. Yet French films , and not only the serials, also contributed: Feyder's costly Madeleine cinema for a whole year. Equally important, however; the luxury cinemas or palaces, most of them again

as 'flagships' for their circuits, generated an unusually high volume of receipts There were Aubert-Palaces in nearly every major French city as well as the 2,0OO-seat Tivoli in Paris As its interests shifted to distribution and exhibition, Gaumont acquired control of the Madeleine, which, with the Gaumont-Palace, served to anchor its Paris circuit. Pathé renovated the Pathé-Palace into the Caméo, constructed formed an alliance with a new circuit in the capital, Lutetia-Fournier. Only a few Paris palaces remained independent: the Salle Marivaux, constructed in 1919 by Edmond Benoît-Lévy, and the Ciné Max-Linder. Yet even the exhibition sector was not safe from American intervention. In 1925 Paramount began buying or building luxury cinemas in half a dozen major cities, culmina in the 2,000-seat Paramount-Palace, which opened in Paris for the 1927 Christlong established a programme schedule which featured a single film en exclusivité with a serial episode andJor introduced the concept of the double-bill programme\_ Furthermore, it was prepared to spend lavishly on advera year it was taking in nearly 10 per cent of the total cinema receipts in Paris. along

Although Delluc abhorred them, serials were distinctive component of the French cinema, remaining popular well into the late 1920s. Initially, they followed the pattern established by Feuillade during the war. In TihMinh (1919) and Barrabas (1920), Feuilladehimself returned to criminal gangs operating with almost metaphysical power in a world described by Francis Lacassin as a tourist's nightmare of exotic locales' \_ Volkoff's adaptation of Jules Mary's La Maison du mystère 'The house of mystery' 1922) focused instead on textile industrialist (Ivan Mosjoukine) falsely imprisoned for a crime and forced to exonerate himself in series of deadly combats with devilish rival. Another pattern began to develop out of The three musketeers 1921) and Fescourt's Mathias Sandorf (1921): the costume or historical adventure story which Sapène and Nalpas seized on as the basis for the Cinéromans serials. War heroes and adventurer-brigands from the either before or after the French Revolution were especially popular. Fescourt's Mandrin (1924) for depicted the exploits of Robin Hood figure (Mathot) against the landowners and tax collectors of the staged one threat after another to an orphan hero (nearly executed in the Bastille) who finally discovered he was of 'noble blood' . By resurrecting a largely aristocratic society and celebrating valiant; oppositional hero, who both belonged to supposedly glorious past and figured the transition to bourgeois era, the Cinéromans serials also played a significant role, after the war; in addressing a period

The boulevard melodrama continued to serve important asset to the industry for several years after the war. Tristan Bernard's plays, for instance, helped to secure his son Raymond's initial reputation as a film-maker. The more 'artistically' inclined film-makers also continued to drama, extending the advances made during the war; often by means of original scenarios, in what Dulac was the first to call 'impressionist films' . In Jaccuse (Iaccuse' \_ 1919) La Roue ('The wheel' , 1921), Gance experimented further with elliptical pointofview shot sequences, different forms of   rhythmic montage (including rapid montage) and patterns of rhetorical figuring through associational editing.

## BEGINNINGS

The tradition of visual spectacle has deep historical roots in Italy. Aspects of it which are particularly important to the prehistory of cinema include entertainments in travelling shows-from the 'Mondo Niovo' of the late eighteenth century to the nineteenth   century 'Megaletoscopio'-and scientific curiosities (documented by A. Riccò in his 1876 study Esperienze   cromostroboscopiche , 'Chromostroboscopic experiments'). It is in this context that the first appearance of the 'Cinématographe Lumière' in the Roman photographic atelier Le Lieure; on 13 March 1896, provoked an excited reaction and this new several other cities Markedly less success awaited the

As local distribution initiatives multiplied, the Société Lumière made its presence felt thanks to four cameramen: Vittorio Calcina, Francesco Felicetti, Giuseppe Filippi, and Albert Promio. As well as actualities and scenes from real chioni, who built his own camera in 1896 along with his brother Enrico, and of the variety artist Leopoldo Fregoli, who used the Cinématographe  (renamed the 'Fregoligraph') to reproduce the quickchange impressions that had made him famous throughout Europe. But these were isolated efforts, which did very little to contribute towards the setting up ofstable, commercially viable projects. For almost ten years, therefore, the diffusion of cinema in Italy was dependent on sporadic initiatives taken by travelling performers, by photographers who café-concert clubs

It was not until nearly a decade after 1896 that such fragmented elements came together to create number of production companies constructed on more solid base. Some of these very quickly acquired pioneering role in their field. In Rome, there was the Alberini & Santoni studio (1905) which changed its name to Cines in April 1906; in Milan, companies owned by Adolfo Croce and Luca Comerio (the latter became SAFFI-Comerio in 1908 and then Milano Films in late 1909); in Turin, which was the real capital of Italian cinema in the period of its creation, Ambrosio (1905), Aquila Film founded by Camillo Ottolenghi (1907), Pasquali and Tempo (1909), and Carlo Rossi & Co. formed in 1907 and renamed Itala Film in 1908 at the behest of Giovanni Pastrone and Carlo Sciamengo.

The recently formed companies struggled to find adequate distribution outlets for their work, and responded by adopting a strategy which aimed to exploit the popularity enjoyed by three particular genres: hiswhich demand exhibitors was growing at a remarkable pace Comerio, Ambrosio, Itala, and Cines all developed an aggressive policy of documentary and realofnatural beauty which hadnot yet been covered by Pathé, Éclair, and Gaumont, as well as to areas struck by natural disasters (such as Calabria and Sicily after the 1909 earthquake) Of particular note were Giovanni Vitrotti, who worked for Ambrosio in Italy and abroad, and Roberto Omegna, who began with Milano Films a career in scientific documentaries which lasted for several decades .

The two principal candidates, both employed by Pathé, were Max Linder; who was already on the way up, even if not arrived at stardom; and André Deed (pseudonym of André Chapuis) who had served a brief apprenticeship under Georges Méliès before moving on to Pathé and immense success in Pastrone chose Deed, changed his nickname to Cretinetti (or Foolshead in Britain and America) and, from January 1909 onwards, produced series of around 100 short comedies, interrupted only anical man' , Milano Films) yet

The main ingredients of the phenomenal world-wide success enjoyed by Deed from 1909 to 1911 were the surreal use of visual tricks and the acceleration of the hectic rhythm typicalofchase comedies . With its madcap, almost hysterical pace, its systematic destruction of whatDeed's work constitutes an anarchic paradigm of transformation, in the nihilistic sense, of everyday urban comedy. His example was followed by every one of the major companies of the time, creating a gallery of around forty characters of varying talent and fortune. The most interesting personalities amongst them were the circus repertoire of clownery in making film comedies Some, such as Kri-Kri, created visual novelties and original situations which wereoccasionally upgraded to more complex forms of mise-en-scène. 12,

The development of the third strand in Italian pro duction of this period was based on the reconstruction of historical settings and characters, from Ancient Greece and Rome to the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and, to a lesser extent, the eighteenth century and the Napoleonic era. The trend towards this sort of production, partly derived from French Italiana was founded by Pathé in 1909), was immediately

The success of the new genre became an important cultural   phenomenon with the release of The Fall of Troy (La caduta di Troia, 1911), directed by Giovanni Pastrone and Romano L Borgnetto for Itala film was greeted with unprecedented approval in Europe and America, inspired by its spectacular monudeur. public

## THE POWER AND THE GLORY

Such aspiration to the status of art formed the basis of the most successful period in the history of Italian silent cinema which, despite the relatively modest resources available to its creators, managed to secure a deserved duction nations between 1911 and 1914. Progress   was aided by the support forthcoming from a new generation of entrepreneurs, with its roots in the aristocracy or in took over the role of the pioneers who had laid the foundations for stable production system only few years earlier.

These members of the privileged classes could call upon immense resources in order to pursue such prestigious hobby as film-making. But their contribution was not solely economic in nature They also brought certain instinct for patronage and philanthropy; insisting on the potential of the moving image as an instrument for the moral and cultural education of a nation which was still in large part illiterate. For Or ill provided the Italian film industry with the entrepreneurial backing which had been strikingly absent thus far from the spontaneous, dilettante approaches of the first practitioners. good they

In a short of time, the trend towards grand spectacle produced two costly films, both set in Ancient which were destined to have an enormous impact on the development of film production: The Last Days of Pompeii Ambrosio, 1913), directed by Eleuterio Rodolfi 1,958 metres , with, literally, a cast of hundreds; and Quo vadis? (Cines, 1913) by Enrico Guazzoni, whose length (2,250m.) had only ever been surpassed by the Danish film Atlantis (Nordisk, 1913) by August Blom period Rome-

Encouraged by the didactic mission of its backers, the full-length feature film emerged earlier in Italy than in most other countries. La Gerusalemme liberata (The Cruby Francesco Bertolini and Adolfo Padovan, in collaboration with Giuseppe De Liguoro; was two years in the making and was announced as measuring 1,300 metres. long;

results of this ambition was Padre ('Father' , Gino Zaccaria andJor Dante Testa, 1912)in which Ermete Zacconi, great theatre actor, appeared in front of the camera for the first time. The even grander aim of Cabiria was to obtain the collaboration and support of the most famous intellectual figure of the era, Gabriele D'Annunzio. D'Annunzio agreed to write the intertitles for the film, and was even credited as its author. However; beyond its literary echoes and its weighty architectural apparatus , Cabiria offers stylistic and technological solutions which make it pioneering, avant-garde work. Above all, it repeatedly uses tracking shots which move across the scene Although these had already been seen in earlier films, such as, among others , Le Pickpocket mystifié (The pickpocket bewildered' , Pathé, 1911), Sumerki long

The apotheosis of the historical genre was reached with a film which symbolizes the zenith of achievement of silent cinema in Italy: The majestic drama set against the background of the Punic wars between Rome and Carthage was by a wide margin the most lavish film made in that era. Pastrone gifted but reclusive figure, was the first producer to grasp the for sound managerial attitude to film production. Unlike other producers of the time, his background was modest: he had started out on career in bookkeeping, but he came to combine his new technical possibilities, such as a camera for amateurs designed to shoot four separate films using a single length of 35 mm film divided into four segments; and 'stereo scopic' and 'natural colour' shooting which were tried, without success, for Cabiria. He acquired fund of technical knowledge for his company by hiring an expert from Pathé whose forte was effects , Segundo de Chomón. He reorganized his company in 1910 with the adoption of a rigorous and efficient set of internal regulations written out in detail and distributed to all employees. And finally; he secured sound financial base thanks to the success of André Deed's comedies and to number of 'sensational films such as Tigris, by Vincenzo C. Dénizot, produced in 1913 and inspired by the success of the French Fantômas series by Louis Feuillade. All these elements created for Pastrone the opportunity to develop and extend formal and expressive fields of research. need special

With the emergence of the full-length feature the Italian film industry underwent a further transformation In order to make profit on smaller number of film shows, the exhibitors enlarged their halls, ticket prices designed in part for workingclass audiences, cinema became middle class form of entertainment. This new situation accentuated the competition between companies, whose number grew to excess after 1915, challenging the monopoly of the bigger companies; and hampering any further consolidation ofthe newly formed production base. The embryonic 'studio system~ years after 1910 was thus by growing mentation of the industry . large replaced frag;

One effect of this new situation, as in all the other major film-making countries, was the decline of the documentary and the comic short, which from this moment on became mere programme-fillers. Conversely; there was sharp increase in grandiose productions, which aimed to develop what were held to be the highest ofideals, such as the promotion of the nationalist spirit or of religious values In the wake of the success of Quo vadis?, Enrico Guazzoni   emerged as specialist in historical reconstruction through series of monumental dramas set in Ancient Rome, such as Antony and Cleopatra (Marcantonio e Middle Ages (a newversion ofLa Gerusalemme liberata, Guazzoni Film, 1918), or in the period of the Napoleonic Wars (Scuola d'eroi , Cines, 1914; UK title How Heroes are Made; US title For Napoleon and France). The same direction was followed by Luigi Maggi, Mario Caserini, Ugo Falena (Giuliano Catholic orthodoxy in this context were Christus (Cines, Medusa Film, 1919) by Carmine Gallone

## REALISM: THE FIRST WAVE

Alongside the trend towards a cinema aimed at highbrow audiences , the more popular forms, out of which cinema

had originally developed, also flourished . However; in this area, Italy remained dependent on vogues and develop ments brought in from abroad The line of 'sensational" crime dramas which had begun with Tigris found its greatest exponent in the eccentric, and, given the gossip surrounding his private life, also somewhat romantic figure of Emilio Ghione. In Nelly la gigolette (Caesar Film\_ 1914) Ghione created the character of Za la Mort-a Frenchlooking scoundrel living among apache gangsters\_who starred in serials such as La banda delle cifre (The numbers gang' , Tiber-Film; 1915) Il triangolo giallo ('The trirats' , Tiber-Film, 1918), which allexploited the restrictions imposed by a low-cost production to produce tight; nervous narrative pace while making full use of the visual resources provided by the landscapes of the Roman countryside yellow

The stamp of realism which is clearly identifiable in I topi grigi is also evident in another undoubtedly sig runs   through Italian cinema of the 1910s The most accomplished exemplar of this trend was Sperduti nel buio ('Lostinthedark' , Morgana Films, 1914), by Nino Martoglio and Roberto Danesi; which has acquired an air of legend owing to the mysterious circumstances surrounding its disappearance. Many other works made between 1912and 1916 bear witness to a marked taste for the observation of everyday life, often intertwined with elements of melo drama-as in emigrante light comedies such as Addio giovinezza! 'Farewell youthl' , Itala Film, 1913), directed by Nino Oxilia and remade twice by Augusto Genina in 1918 and 1927. Other films present examples of straightforward naturalism: such as Assunta Spina (Caesar Film, 1915) by Gustavo Serena and Francesca Bertini-adapted play by Salvatore Di Giacomo \_ Ambrosio, Jr., from a book by Sardinian novelist Grazia Deledda. The latter was the only film made by the great theatre actress Eleonora Duse. from

## FROM DECADENTISM TO DECADENCE

The outbreak of the First World War and the growing power of American cinema in the European market put an abrupt end to dreams of expansion of the Italian industhe weak national economy diverted energies from other activities, and this draining of resources would only get worse in the aftermath of the disastrous defeat by the films which were made were dedicated to the theme of war, thus producing of the documentary Propaganda efforts even extended into genre.

The geographical and financial dispersal of production centres , the lack of any coordiof much of the production system meant that, at the first signs of difficulty; the industry was brought to its knees

After the end of the war, in 1919, one late and doomed salvage attempt was made when group of bankers and producers, with the support of two powerful financial institutions; set up the Unione Cinematografica Italiana (UCI) , a trust under whose aegis were gathered the eleven largest production companies in the country. But the initiative did more harm than vised attempt to create a production monopoly to control good.

Already by December 1921, the failure of one of the major backers of the scheme the Banca Italiana di Sconto-had seriously wounded the consortium, and from 1923 its constituent companies plunged one by one into a fatal crisis. From that moment onwards, rates of output decreased rapidly; and Italian cinema sank into a mire which it was not to re emerge until after the end of the silent period. hope from

One of the genres which may be seen as partly responsible for the decline had been born in the period before the war Its protagonists were set of actresses whose personalities and style gave rise to the cult of the a certain time even spread to other European countries and to the the short-lived meteoric career of acting

was the signal forerunner of the genre, with its simplified and exaggerated appropriation of symbolism and dentism. In the following decade; its influence was felt throughout Italian society Lyda Borelli, the diva par excellence set the standard of style based more on the charismatic presence of the actress than on any technical or aesthetic qualities of the production. In her films the expressivity of the body was assigned a determining role. The characters played by Borelli-and by other divas such Maria Jacobini, Soava Gallone, Helena Makowska, Hesperia, Italia Almirante frail melancholia and anxiety, expressed through mannered poses. They live in luxuriant and at times oppressively opulent surroundings, where excited glances and sharp movements mirror the excess of the costumes and scenery

The perverse, sometimes evil nature of the divas was reinforced by the screenplays, which were tailor-made for nificance of the director. Rapsodía satanica ('Satanic rhapsody' ) by Nino Oxilia (with an orchestral score composed for the film by Pietro Mascagni) and Malombra by striking examples of the aesthetic of 'borellismo' , the cinematic equivalent of the Italian taste for neo-classical and   Pre-Raphaelite Some performers, however; did manage to create distinctive styles Francesca Bertini, who starred in Sangue blu ('Blue blood') by Nino Oxilia (Celio Film, 1914), had a somewhat more sober, and at times even naturalistic, acting style; and Pina Menichelli achieved morbid dramatic intensity in (The flame" Itala Film, 1915) and Tigre reale Royal tiger' Itala Film, 1916, from the story by Giovanni Verga)

Exceptions apart, in the 1920s melodrama of this kind became the staple fare ofItalian cinema. Both quality and quantity suffered and the industry turned in on itself, confusing the ruins of its former glories with potential new directions. The last vestiges of the aspiration to artis-

The narrative world built up around the divas amounted to a compendium of love and intrigue in upper bourgeois and aristocratic circles, world marked by rigid social conventions and uncontainable passions detached from any sense of reality as to constitute a closed universe, dominated by sex and death\_ A remarkable exception to this rule seems to have been the work of attrice cicala formica ('The famous actress cicada ant' , 1920) and La tragedia su tre carte ( 'Tragedy on three cards' , 1922) were characterized by an eccentric but rich figurative elegance.

Of course, some of these relics were also notable commercial successes. The exceptional demand for Cabiria had trone even made synchronized version in 1931, which version of the original appeared in 1995. The success of Cabiria was due to the character of the slave Maciste (Bartolomeo Pagano), whose athletic prowess made him a favourite with audiences and spawned series of films devoted to him, from Maciste (Itala Film, 1915), by Vincenzo Dénizot and Romano L Borgnetto, to the Regiment' , Itala Film, 1916), by Luigi Maggi and Romano L Borgnetto; to the apotheosis of kitsch in Maciste all'inferno (Fert-Pittaluga; 1926) by Guido Brignone These were the first in the tradition of 'strong-man' films, an athletic variant on the adventure film, whose protagonists are endowed with extraordinary physical strength and untarnished simplicity of emotion. Pagano's lead was followed of the athlete-cum-acrobat-cum-actor: Sansone (Luciano Albertini), Saetta (Domenico Gambino) Galaor (Domenico the Giovanni Raicevich long

Elsewhere, the fading fortunes of cinema on a national scale contributed to spontaneous renaissance in a formerly minor area of film-making, the Neapolitan dialect melodrama The companies behind this strange phenomenon were in some cases organized on a family basis. The films were distributed mainly in southern Italy and in the larger northern cities, although on occasion were exported to wherever emigrant communities had settled The Dora Film Company; owned by Elvira and Nicola Notari which had been founded shortly after 1910, succeeded in infusing its films with simplicity and authenticity which was far removed the anodyne 'modernity' of the commercial being made for they from

nation-wide audiences. 'A santanotte (Holy Night) and Epiccerella ('The little girl' , Film Dora, 1922), both directed by Elvira Notari, are two of the most important films in a genre   which has its roots in the  Neapolitan   popular theatre form, the sceneggiata (a simple, powerful drama acted by non-professionals, with no artistic Or technical training, and yet which managed to strike chord with the audiences feelings.

In the desolate panorama of the national film industry at the end of the 1920s, there are some signs of renewal. The influence ofthe Fascist regime was still only marginal: it had set up the Istituto Nazionale LUCE (acronym of LUnione Cinematografica Educativa-the Union ofCinema and Education) in 1924 with the aim of exploiting cinema for propagandist and didactic ends, but it generally re frained from direct intervention in the affairs of the industry. Aldo De Benedetti demonstrated in ('Grace' , Attori Direttori Italiani Associati, 1929) how

Still in Naples, Gustavo Lombardo had set up his own production company in 1918 which emerged unscathed the 1920s, when directors, actors, and technicians were leaving in droves for France and Germany, Lombardo Film continued to produce steady stream of relatively goodquality films; including a number starring the talented actress Leda Gys. Gys had performed with outstanding results alongside Francesca Bertini in the pantomime HisItalica Ars Celio Film\_ 1914) by Baldassarre Negroni. For Lombardo, she made a list drama with significant degree of polemical social critique. Lombardo Film changed its name to Titanus, and Pittaluga in a move which radically transformed the distribution system throughout Italy trilogy

The tendency among film historians has always been to represent the British cinema as having had influential and then to have fallen into decline and stagnation. From this perspective, as expressed for example by Georges Sadoul (1951) Rescued by Rover (Cecil Hepworth; 1905) is the high point. Films produced after that date, particularly in the

period (1908-13) when onereel dramatic narrative was dominant, have been neglected. Even writers like Barry Salt (1992), who has done a careful formal analysis of films from the early years, have focused perhaps unduly on fictional dramatic narrative, at the expense of the comic film and-even more important-the various forms ofactufilm ality

even traditional story-line could give rise to style of filming of extraordinary purity.

The first Italian sound film to be released was a sentimental comedy by Gennaro Righelli, La canzone dell'amore (The love song' which came out also in French and German versions. It was shortly followed by Sole ('Sun' , Società Anonima Augustus, 1929) by Alessandro Blasetti, a film about the draining of the Pontine marshes which showed the influence of German and Soviet cinema. Another young director, Mario Camerini, who had already shown himself capable of injecting new energy into the worn formulas of adventure films and bourgeois comedies through more smooth and technically sophisticated Direttori Italiani Associati, 1928) now took a further step forwards with Rotaie (Rails' , SACIA, 1929), which was shot as a silent film, came out two years later in a sound version. The Sole and Rotaie are marked by clearly differing intentions, but both are inclined towards experimentation with new forms which refashion with vision and authority the Italian vocation for realism\_ but

## BRITISH CINEMA FROM HEPWORTH TO HITCHCOCK

As a result of these historiographical biases, a certain injustice has been done to British films ofthe immediately been overlooked\_ in the light of later developments, notably those that came to be part of the dominant Hollywood mode from 1913 onwards. In fact British films of the were often sophisticated, particularly in the comic and actuality fields. Narrative innovations tended to be in directions which went against the grain of what was to prove the dominant approach. period quite

## EARLY FORMAL DEVELOPMENTS

Before 1907-8,it was the actuality (in its broadest generic sense) and the comic film that dominated British prO duction output. Producers were geographically wide spread, although in the period after 1906 most of the production companies were located in or around London. Thousands of titles were produced; before 1902 most consisted of only one shot; but by 1905 lengthier films had led to the development of some reasonably complex editing example; the pointofview shot pair came A particularly early example of this narrational strategy can be found in the Gaumont (British) film The Blacksmith's Daughter (1904). Here the second shot of the pointofview shot pair is cued by having an old man lift a child up to look over fence, into garden which couple (the daughter of the title the field of vision; it lacks the presence in shot of the looker(s)  but is taken from the space occupied by the man and the child in the previous shot. That this is intended as a point-ofview perspective is shown by the fact that the the fence, with the railings clearly visible in the second shot.

The Blacksmith's Daughter is not the only early British film The 1906 actuality A Visit to Peek Frean and Co 's Biscuit Works (Cricks and Sharp, 1906) is remarkable not only for its relative length-in excess of 2,000 feet when most fictional use of high-angle camera shots, panning. and tilt move ment, and its use of scene dissection to give a more coMplete view of specific factory processes\_

Despite the attention that has been paid by film historians to the development of early editing practices, one particular technique; which has relevance to comic, actulooked; the jump cut in the context of shots which maintain continuity of framing. For example, in The Missing Legacy; 0r, The of a Brown Hat (Gaumont Film between the protagonist and three men, there is a cut at the Story point

where the protagonist is wrestled to the ground. This is not 'lost footage' but a jump cut which allows the man's clothing to be reduced to tatters during the absent time of the cut. The film-maker disguised this lack of clothing continuity by having the action staged largely out of frame, and by having the protagonist partially obscured by his attackers . Similarly   the jump cut is important in the narrative construction of some of the actuality films of the period. Railway-Constructing the Locomotive (Urban, 1905) the jump cut (keeping continuity of framing) is used to create the temporal ellipsis that allows various stages in the process to be shown, including both initial and final stages of construction.

Film-makers of this period in fact showed considerable ingenuity in developing editing and shooting practices which ensured the effect desired, whether in comic and actuality films OI dramatic narrative films For whereby actor movement is used to simulate camera movement, has been noted in thecase ofLadies Skirts Nailed to a Fence (Bamforth, 1900). However; this practice was not restricted to such comic sketches, but clearly also had function in fictional dramatic narratives\_ they

Cecil Hepworth's Rescued by Rover (1905) was major commercial success , and in order to produce enough prints to meet demand, Hepworth's company remade the film twice. From a narrative perspective all three films are the same\_ but at the level of film form there are some small significant differences. In the first version of the film the scene in which the remorse-stricken nurse bursts handled differently from the two later versions The first version breaks this scene down into two shots, the second being filmed from closer camera position and at slightly different angle to the action\_ The other two veruse of scene dissection, whilst the later versions do not. If we view scene dissection as development in film form\_ then here we have seeming regressionWhat has pened, however; is rather that the film-maker has learnt from the mistake in the staging of the scene in the first version, in which the two shots of this scene perceptually as change of camera position when it is actually the actors who moved. Thus by 1905 Hep worth had a clear idea of how close the camera should be forward to accommodate. When confronted by a similar problem in a scene in year, Hepworth moved the camera forward, since the staging of the action (with an attempted exit through window being dramatically important) precluded the possibility of moving the actors yet hap register have

The fact that British films in the period up to 1906-7 were successful and influential, nationally and internationally, Even contemporary critical writing confirms the view of the superiority of British films vis-à-vis their American counterparts. An editorial in the Projection Lantern and Cinematograph of July 1906 states , StatesThe demand for films is exceptionally heavy, with the result that very inferior subjects are produced\_ many of which would not be tolerated at British halls' The British success was derived from both innovative filmAffray) and the fact that international markets were open. However; by 1912 the situation had reversed. The Picture World of 20 January 1912 commented, 'English films in this country are hopeless on the market and cannot even please the Canadians . So why the fall? Hep worth himself, in his autobiography, refers to being 'not sufficiently alive to the many changes which were occurin the and such Hepworth films as Dumb Sagacity (1907) and The Outwits the Kidnappers (1908) do show a remarkable similarity (in story and film form) to the earlier Rescued by Rover. Added to the perceived lack of quality of British films, and not unrelated, was the effective closure of the American market to British producers with the formation of the Motion Picture Patents Company in 1908. being Moving drug ring Dog

The importance of the Daring series can also be gauged

It was around this   time that the series film appeared on British screens. The British and Colonial Kine matograph Company (hereafter B & C.) moved into the production of series films at an early date. The Exploits of Three-Fingered Kate (First Series) was reviewed in the Bioscope in October 1909, and a number of series were to follow in the years leading up to the First World of popular success none was more important than the Lieutenant Daring series, which first appeared in 1911; the Bioscope of 28 March 1912 published an interview (and photograph) of Lieutenant Daring, the famous English film actor'\_ However, since the interview was conducted with references solely to Daring the fctional character; then it would be more correct to refer to the notion of a picture personality rather than star. From the perspective of film form these B. & C. series films are also interesting because of their use of emblematic shots (of the eponymous herojheroine) at the end (or, less often, at the beginning) of the films. Their inclusion might be seen in terms of a generic code, since shots of this type are relatively rare in other film genres, with the exception of the comic film where emblematic shots can be found at the beginning or end of the film in productions from various British companies. again

to the West Indies in 1913 (something of a first for a British company to take its artists such distance), Percy Moran was in the party, and at least one series entry was shot in Jamaica; It. and the Dancing Girl. Although the West Indies was its most far and exotic shooting location\_ this company often made use of scenic location shooting, a fact that its publicity emphasized. For example, the first in the Don Qseries of films (1912) was advertised as having been filmed amidst Derbyshire's rugged and picturesque hills, and this strategy of foregrounding scenic pleasure is structured into the film itself in The Mountaineer's Romance (1912), when an introductory title card announces\_ This trict, Derbyshire' Daring flung

The parodic film appeared relatively early in British film production. In the same year as Charles Urban first produced his Unseen World series of films, the Hepworth Company made parody of it. The format of the Urban series was based on combining the technologies of the microscope and the movie camera, to produce magnified views of the natural world' . Hepworth's The Unclean World (1903) has man place piece of the food he has been eating under microscope. circular reveals two beetles, but the joke is realized when two their clockwork mechanisms.

It was with the series film, however, that the parody almost developed into genre in its own right. B. & C's 'Three-Fingered Kate' who of Éclair's 'Nick Carter-le roi des détectives' . The sending up of current events and particularly current film successful screen comic in Britain around 1913-14, who in the latter year produced a number of spoof 'Lieutenant the Stolen Invention The Hepworth Company was also producing lence of these cheap-to-produce parodies is an indicator both of the lack of any comic star in the British cinema in the pre-war of British film production; with the concomitant lack of finance, since much of the comic pleasure of these film requirementwas thattheaudience could make the necessary link back to the parodied film(s) and most often this was clearly signalled in the titles themselves.

Although at producing popular and cheap series and parodies for thehome market, British companies were slow at exploiting their own cultural heritage, unlike the American competitors such as Vitagraph, who produced A Tale of Two Cities (1911) to celebrate the centenary of Dickens\_ British   producers concentrated heavily on good

narrative had become the staple of the industry. For example, of the films released in Britain in January 1910, the only British company with significant number of fictional drama releases is Hepworth, and these were considerably shorter than comparable films from European and American producers (three of the four dramas released by Hepworth in that month were less than 500 feet, whereas European and American dramas were closer to 1,000).

degree of optimism Cecil Hepworth (1951) and George Pearson (1957) was that by 1911-12 British companies had largely caught up lost ground. This was particularly true for companies like Hepworth and B. & C., who began to produce a more attractive product through, for example, the dramatic use of good

number of American companies 'tied in' British exhibitors For example; the Gaumont Weekly of 28 August 1913 complained, 'Many theatres have exclusive contracts with the American manufacturers-a cheap way of supplying the theatre' Almost coincident with the shift to multireel films as the industrial norm was the emergence of a star system in America This was not the case in Britain where even in the 1920s the only actresses who could be called British film stars were Chrissie White and Alma Taylor (particularly through their work with Hepworth) and Betty Balfour. Stars in general and male film stars in particular were signifcantly lacking, in period when were so central to the rise to dominance of the American film. Indeed; writing as late as 1925, Joseph Schenck commented brutally on British film productions: 'You have no personalities to puton the screen. Thestage actors and actresses are no on the screen. Your effects are no good, and you do not spend nearly so much money' (Bioscope, 8 January 1925). Related to the lack of male stars in the British film industry was an accompanying lack of any action genre equivalent to the Western; and thelackof light comedy; genres which established so many American male stars in the 1910s and 1920s. they good

As Hepworth somewhat poignantly states in his attempts to find an American distributor, home

Despite the low esteem in which most British film productions were held, particularly in the international market-place; optimism remained high in the immediate post-war years in the British trade press, though the idea of a protection system, for example by the imposition of import quotas, was beginning to ground. The London Film Company had made use (producers and actors) as means of differentiating its products from other British producers as early as 1913, and continued with this strategy through the war years\_ although with the quite specific aim of breaking into international markets , particularly the American. Despite some initial success , the American market remained as elusive for this company as it proved for other British producers , and by the mid-1920s the company went out of business can be seen as the nadir of the British film industry; according to the Moyne Report not more than 5 per cent of films exhibited British studios

But it was not only American distribution practices and lack of capitalization Or a star system which hampered the potential success of the British film. At a time when American films the dynamic traits associated with continuity editing, British films were often marked by narrational uncertainty and the inability to construct unified spatio-temporal narrative logic (the hallmarks of what we now call the classical Hollywood style). For example, the distinction between fade and cut shot transitions, which had become clearly

Although Hepworth's films of the 1910s and 1920s were admittedly idiosyncratic; other British films from this exhibited varying degrees of narrational uncertainty A lengthy part of the narrative in Barker's melodrama The Road to Ruin (1913) is devoted to dream sequence. However; clearly uncertain as to the audience's ability to follow the narrative logic of the story, the filmmakers twice remind the spectator of the dream status of the events unfolding; once through a return to a shot of the protagonist dreaming, and once through the interpolation of an intertitle, which simply states, ~and dreaming still point-ofview 1910s, was sometimes used with a degree of equivocation\_ Many of the films of the early 1910s did not use optical point of view but moved the camera 180 degrees in relation to the character looking off screen, s0 that the second shot reveals not only the object of the look, but also the 'looker point in The and the Rajah (London Film Co., 1914), the film makes use of ofview shots. One of these has the rajah looking intently off screen, through some open French windows. This is followed by a shot of the rajah's rival in love, from camera placement that approximates to the rajah's optical viewpoint. The relationship between these shots was clearly not regarded as selfexplanatory; and an intertitle is introduced, with the words 'What the Rajah saw' The next shot, which has both the looker (the rajah's servant) and the object of the look in shot is then in turn preceded by an intertitle which states, What the servant saw sug gesting distinct lack of confidence in the audience's ability to read pointofview articulations, in spite of the period key Ring point-

Thus it was not only under-capitalization, or the lack of a star system, but also aspects of film form that made British films so uncompetitive with those of the United States .

this period. Both Michael Balcon (producer) and Herbert Wilcox (producer-director) adopted similar strategies to develop the indigenous industry. One such strategy was the importation of Hollywood stars. This was not a total novelty, but in the past it had met with only limited a deal with Paramount. More important was the development of coproduction agreements by both Balcon and Wilcox, and other British producers. Co-productions, particularly with Germany but also with other countries such as Holland would become a significant factor in the development of the British film industry in the mid- and late 1920s. It was as a result of this practice that the young Alfred Hitchcock acquired   experience of German production methods when he was sent to work at the Ufa studios in Neuearly on in his career with Gainsborough\_ berg

The light(by Karl Fischer) the use of a variety of camera angles, and the rapid editing of some sequences linked the film more to a German mode of expression. These elements combined with the fact that the screenplay was not developed from production, unlike so many British productions in the 1920s, produced that was pure cinema. ing

Michael Balcon was an important figure in the British film industry for number of Although he produced only a relatively small number of films in the 1920s, most of them, including The Rat (Gainsborough 1925), were big commercial successes Further, Balcon's career was a clear signpost to that division of labour that came rather late in the industry: that is, between producing and directing. Balcon was a producer; rather than producer -director, and it was only the sep aration of these roles that allowed the development of skills specifically associated with each function.

Although in the context of British culture film-making was generally held in low esteem, a number of university graduates were to enter the film industry towards the end of this period; including Anthony Asquith, the son of the Liberal Prime Minister. Asquith had not only developed a considerable knowledge of European cinema during his university days, but his privileged background enabled him to meet many Hollywood stars and directors during his visits to the United StatesThe importance of these factors became evident when he began his film career.

By the end of the 1920s the British film industry was transformed. The shift to vertical integration established stronger and despite its negative aspects, the protective legislation introduced in 1927 did also lead to an expansion of the industry. The new generation who entered the industry in the mid-1920s had a greater knowledge and understanding of developments taking place in both European cinema and Hollywood, and this was also to play its part in the transformation of the British cinema, making it better prepared to face the introduction of sound at the end of the decade

In 1909 he opened a 1,200 seater cinema at the Berlin Alexanderplatz; and took up production\_ to complement his supply of films from foreign in Paris and the Nordisk Film Kompagni in Copenhagen.

Eisner's and Kracauer's powerful portraits left much else about the early German cinema in the shadows In some respects, the spotlight cast on the early and mid-1920s only deepened the darkness into which prejudice and physical destruction had already plunged the first two decades of German film history.

As to German film stars, there is no doubt that the first one was Kaiser Wilhelm Il himself, always shown strutting with his generals and admirals. Asta Nielsen was soon rivalled by Henny Porten (a discovery of Messter) as Germany's major female star of the pre-war period, though she remained much less well known internationally.

## GERMAN CINEMA AND THE FIRST WORLD WAR

Ihe upturn and consolidation of German film production was thus already well under way when war broke out, and the immediate effect of hostilities on the film business was mixed. With an import embargo in force, some firms, such as PAGU, suffered substantial losses before were able to organize new sources of film supply. But there were also winners for whom the confiscation of property from the foreign firms operating in Germany; and the soaring demands for films, signalled a unique opportunity. A new generation of producers and producer-directors made initial ban on cinema-going. Erich Pommer, a young sales representative for the French firms Gaumont and Éclair, seized his chance and formed Decla ('Deutsche Éclair') which was to become the producer of German quality cinema after the war: Among the new firms which flourished was that of soon the they key May,

However, films on war subjects were the exception. Serials featuring male stars made up the bulk of the pro duction, with the then-famous actors Ernst Reicher, Alwin following thatallowed them single-handedly to keep their respective companies in Female serial queens like Fern Andra and Hanni Weisse were also prolific, while directors like Joe would make an average of six to eight films a moving effortlessly between popular films (Sensationsfilme) and art films (Autorenfilme) .

The quality of German films from the war years has rarely been assessed impartially. Some featuring the war; and often dismissed as patriotic propaganda filmsor 'fieldgrey kitsch' , turn out to be major surprises . Thus, the films of Franz Hofer (e.g. Weihnachtsglocken ('Christmas bells' ) 1914) are stylistically sophisticated, projecting a feel both distinctively German and of jingoism, as plead for self-sacrifice and peace between the social classes. An unusual blend of melodrama and lyricism can be found in Wenn Völker streiten (When nations quarrel' , 1914) as well as several other films which take the war as subject (such as Alfred Halm's Ihr Unteroffizier ('Their non-commissioned officer' 1915)). Among the melodramas, the of Dr Hart , 1916), directed by Paul Leni and funded by story of two families with split political loyalties and crossed love interests, Das Tagebuch is an anti-tsarist propaganda film in the of championing Polish nationalit also makes strongly   pacifist statement through the realistic battle scenes, the depiction of the wounded in field hospitals, and images of rural devastation. free they guise

## Conrad Veidt (1893-1943}

Conrad Veidt started his career in 1913, at Max Reinhardts acting school. After a short period of employpressionist acting style that made him an international half of the decade, but returned to Germany on the introduction of sound, starring in some of the early Ufa sound successes and their English versions In 1932 Veidt started work in Britain, shooting a proSemitic version of Jew Suss (1934) and the more equivocal Wandering Jew (1933), after which he became persona non grata in Nazi Germany. With his Jewish wife Lily Preger he remained in London, gaining British citizenship in 1939. He continued to work incarnating Prussian officers for Victor Saville and Michael Powell. In 1940 he moved to Hollywood, where he was cast mainly as Nazi~most famously, Major Strasser in Casablanca (1942)

Veidts face reveals much of the inner life of his characters. The playofmuscles beneath the taut skin, the lips pressed together,a vein on his temple visibly protruding, nostrils Baring in concentration and self-discipline. These physical aspects characterize the artists, soverthe Prussian officers of the British and Hollywood periods.

From Cesare to Major Strasser, Veidts portrayals of knowledge that verted and stoic edge, accepting their fate and never compromising in order to save their own lives al ways remain true to their mission and often border on the fanatical in their sense of duty and singleness of vitheir manners and cosmopolitan elegance they good

To find the origins of the fantastic film, one has to return to the Autorenfilm, whose outstanding figure was neither Hans Heinz Ewers nor Stellan Paul Wegener A celebrated Max Reinhardt actor before he came to make films the genre of the Gothic-Romantic fairy-tale film. After The Student of Prague he acted in and codirected The Golem (1920), based on a Jewish legend and the prototype of all monster Frankensteincreature features. There followed Peter Schlemihl , Rübezahl's Wedding, The Pied Piper of Hamlin, and several other films exploiting the rich vein of German Romantic legend and fairy-tales.

reasons: he was attracted to fantastic subjects because they allowed him to explore  different cinematic niques, such as trick photography, superimposition, special effects in the manner of the French detective Zigomar series, but with a sinister rather than comic motivation. For this, he worked closely with one of the early German cinema's most creative cameramen, Guido Seeber, himself a somewhat underrated pioneer whose many   publications about the art of cinematography, special effects, and lighting are veritable sourcebook understanding the German style of the 1920s\_ But Wegener's fairy-tale films also promoted the ingenious compromise which the Autorenfilm wanted to strike between countering theimmense hostility shown towards the cinema by the educated middle class (manifested in the socalled Kino Debatte') and exploiting what was about the cinema, its popularity. for unique

which the rural-völkisch the national-romantic played an important role and

The Wegener tradition thus set a pattern which was to the 1920s: conservative, nosexperimental and avant-garde outlook film-makers had with regard to advancing the medium's technical possibilities. Seeking to define a national cinema by blending a high-culture concept of national literature with a popular pseudofolk culture, the Wegener tradition tried to take the wind out of the establishment's critical sails. It is the combination of both these objectives in the fantastic film that makes it such a mainstay of the German cinema for at least a decade (from 1913 until about 1923) suggesting that the celebrated 'expressionist flm' is the tail end of this truce between highbrow culture and lowbrow medium, rather than new departure\_ What breathed Caligari; mainly because of its extraordinary reception in France (and subsequently in the United States) , which in turn made producers and directors selfconsciously look for motifs that the export market would recognize as German

The conjunction of boom in demand and war economy had, by the end of the war; led to an unsustainable number of small, undercapitalized production firms competing with each other; some of which had tried to gain an advantage via mergers Or takeovers\_ The frst such association of small producers the Deutsche Lichtbild AG. (Deulig) formed in 1916, backed by heavy industry interests in the Ruhr; and headed by Alfred Hug enberg, then director of Krupp, and also owner of newspaper and publishing empire. One of Hugenberg's chief lieutenants, Ludwig Klitzsch, saw the advantage of diversifying into a potentially profitable medium. He also hada veritable mission to use the cinemaas a promotional tool for both commerce and lobby politics. Klitzsch occupied one of the two nationally organized initiatives-the other the German Leaguewhich had, from about order to The Navy League especially provoked the anger of cinema exhibitors, since it provided by getting free advertising for its the local press, and captive audiences from school officials or local army commandants \_ Navy being

The Reich provided funds to buy out some ofthe owners, while others were offered shares in the new company; with Paul Davidson  becoming the new firm's first head duction\_ The establishment of vertically integrated company of this size meant not only that Deulig was dwarfed but that many other middle-size companies became increasingly dependent on Ufa as Germany's chief domestic exhibitor and export distributor. great

Neither the strategy of such a merger, nor the use of a special interest group for the purposes of creating a film propaganda instrument, were the invention of Ufa's backers. Both obeyed a certain commercial logic, and both belonged to the political culture of Wilhelmine society; making Ufa an expression not so much of the waI; as of a new way of thinking about public opinion and the media in general. By the time Ufa became operational, however;, Germany had been defeated, and the new conglomerate' s was to dominate the domestic as well as the European film market. Its chief assets were in real estate (extensive studio capacity, luxury cinemas all over Germany; laboratories and prime office space in Berlin) while owning Messter brought Ufa horizontal diversification into film goal

Production at first continued under the brand names of the merged firms: PAGU, Messter, Joe Film, Gloria BB-Film, some using the new purpose-built studios in Bab elsberg, soon to become the heart of Ufa and the German film industry. The PAGU team around Davidson and Lub itsch rose to international fame with a series of historical spectaculars and costume dramas, often based on operGroßfilme (Das indische Grabmal Joe May's multi-episode serials like Die Herrin der Welt ( The proved particularly popular to Germany's war-exhausted spectators\_ not least because each episode featured a different continent, with the heroine travelling China to Africa, from India to the United States .

Among the firms which initially did not form part of was Decla\_ headed by Erich Pommer. Decla's first major films after the war were Die Spinnen (The spiders' 1919), an exotic detective serial written and directed by Fritz Lang, and Die Pest in Florenz ( The plague in Florence' , 1919), a historical adventure directed by Rippert and scripted by Lang.

Together with The Cabinet of Dr Caligari; directed by Robert Wiene and written by Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz, these three films made production programme which defined the course that the German cinema was to take in the early 1920s. Popular serials, with exotic locations the 'stylized' (or 'expressionist' film were the backbone of a concept of product differentiation, carried by such directors as Lang and Wiene, Ludwig Berger and F W Murnau, Carl Mayer; Carl Froelich, and Arthur von Gerlach.

Given the decisive role of Caligari in typecasting the German cinema, it is remarkable how ynrepresentative it isofthe films made during theyears of the Weimar Repub lic. Its explicitly 'expressionist' décor remained almost unique, and the few German films that were able to repeat its internationalcommercial success were each very different: Madame Dubarry Variete (1925) The Last Laugh, Metro Yet in one respect Caligari does illustrate a common pattern for the period For in so far as one production strand, strongly though not exclusively identified with 'art cinema structure. The 'lack which, according to narratologists; drives all stories, centres in the Weimar cinema almost invariably on incomplete families, jealousies , over powering father figures, absent mothers, and often is not remedied by an attainable or desired object choice. If one takes a dozen or so of the films still remembered , one is struck by their explicitly Oedipal scenarios, by the recurringrivalry between fathers andsons, by jealousy between has already pointed out, is followed by submission to the law of the fathers but in such haunted by their shadow, their double, their phantom selves . This cluster of motifs can be found in Fritz Lang's Destiny and Metropolis, in Arthur Schatten 1923) and Manon Lescaut   (1926), in E. A Dupont's Das alte Gesetz ('The old law' 1923) and Variete (1925), in Paul Leni's Waxworks (1924) and Hintertreppe (Backstairs' 1921), Lupu Pick 's 1921) and Sylvester (1923), Murnau's The Last Laugh and 1923), and Robert Wiene's Orlacs Hände ('The hands of Orlac' , 1925) polis .

These obliquely symbolic conflicts correspond to indirect forms of narration via framing devices, and nested narratives , as in Caligari, Destiny (1921), Variete, Nosferatu, Zur Chronik von Grieshuus ('The chronicle ~of Grieshuus 1925), and Phantom \_ This often makes the films' temporal structure difficult, if not impossible, to reconstruct, changingby that very fact the viewer's underof character and motivation\_ At the same time the editing often and causal links Or even standing tinuity

uncanny and the mysterious , since so much of the action and the protagonists' motivation has to be guessed, presumed, or otherwise inferred

For many of the stories of Weimar cinema one can identify sources and intertexts from other media. Besides the folk-tales and legends already mentioned in one could add Lang's Destiny and The Nibelungen (1923) Ludwig Berger's Der verlorene Schuh lost shoe' 1923), and Leni Riefenstahl's Das blaue Licht (The blue light' , 1932} the sources are serialized novels from newspapers (Dr Mabuse, Schloss Vogeladaptations of authors identified with Germany's national literature (Goethe Gerhard Hauptmann Theodor Storm). These cross-media influences are indicative of the vertical links already at that time existing suggesting that choice was determined by economic factors, exploiting the popularity and notoriety of the material Yet also continue the middlebrow, consensus-fostering,   canon-forming notion of national cinema, borrowing from literature and a common stock of cultural references . (The Gang they

A particularly striking feature is that among the films most often cited as symptomatic for the inner state of Germany, surprising number were written by just two script-writers: Carl Mayer and Thea von Harbou. With their films that define the 'identity' of Weimar cinema, in particular for the up to 1925: Mayer's Kammerspiel(Genuine Hintertreppe, Scherben , Sylvester, The Last tations of classics, bestsellers, and national (all of Fritz Lang's and three Murnau films, as well as ten by other directors) period epics

the existence of fairly closeknit creative community with the same names turning up repeatedly among the directors , the set  designers , the producers the cameramen, and script-writers. Barely two dozen people seem to have made up the core of the German film establishment of the early 1920s. Largely formed around Ufa and a few other Berlin-based production companies, the groups can be traced directlytothe formation ofproducerdirector units around Joe May, Richard Oswald, Fritz Lang, Friedrich W. Murnau, and the PAGU-Davidson group.

He recognized the importance that export had for the domestic marketitself; as shown in his efforts as deputy director of the Exportverband der deutschen Filmindustrie, founded in May 1920, to put pressure on 'the internal organisation of the market, if necessary by sidestepping the people who currently feel themselves to be in charge of the German film business' (Jacobsen 1989).

In response Pommer tried to establish a common Euro He entered a number of distribution and co-production agreements under the banner 'Film Europe'\_ demonstrating his awareness that, despite its size and centration, Ufa on its was in no position to brave Hollywood even in Europe, not to mention penetrating the US market. Despite its ultimate failure, the Film Europe initiatives laid the groundwork the very extensive contacts that were to exist throughout the late 1920s and lasting well into the 1940s between the German and French and British film-making communities. into for

Madame Dubarry in the USA and Caligari in Europe were the two export successes which broke the international boycott of German On their basis , Pommer firmly in the hands of Hollywood, and the international art-cinema outlets, where what he called the 'stylized German cinema Yet the initial export successes were greatly facilitated by hyperinflation, since depreciation automatically amortized a film's production cost: in 1921 instance, the sale of a feature film to single market like Switzerland earned enough hard currency to finance an entire new production\_ But with the stabilization of the Mark in 1923, this trading advantage disappeared for German production; and Pommer's twin strategy became increasingly precarious. for

Until 1926, when he left for the United States , Pommer's original production system at Ufa remained the director the Decla-Bioskop period, great creative freedom The benefits of this policy are well known: they made up the grandeur of the socalled Ufa style, with scope for technical and stylistic experimentation and improvisation at almost every stage of a project. This led to heavy reliance on studio-work, which 'atmo spheric' , and others merely 'claustrophobic' .

There were drawbacks, too: often it seemed that, with perfectionism and the craft ethos permeating all departments, time and money were no object. Furthermore, the refusal to divide and control the labour processes of film production as was standard practice in Hollywood often came into conflict with production   policy geared

As a capitalist conglomerate, Ufa was the target ofcritics on the left, foremost among them writers from the liberal and social-democratic press, whose culturaldistrust ofthe cinema was hardly less pronounced than that of their conservative colleagues, but for whom Ufa was clearly critics also showed a somewhat contradictory attitude to the popular: denouncing 'artistic' films as Kitsch' despised popular or genre films as 'Schund'\_ thus operaChaplin and in the late 1920s only the Soviet cinema could pass muster. they ting

Yet fending off American competition was not the only front on which the German cinema did battlein the 1920s, and, while it dominated exhibition, Ufa did not make up much more than 18 per cent of the national production. The smaller firms not distributing via Ufa, such as Emelka, own exhibition network by entering into agreements with American and British firms, thus further splitting the German market, to the ultimate advantage of Hollywood.

The predominantly critical attitude ofthe intelligentsia towards both the nation's art cinema and commercial to another paradox: discussions about the cinema, its cultural function, and aesthetic specificity as an art form were conducted at a high level of intellectual and philosophical  sophistication, giving rise to theoreticians and critics of distinction: among them Béla Haas, Hans Siemsen, Herbert Jhering, Kurt Tucholsky; and Hans Feld.

What caused more serious divisions inside the film industry was the local entertainment taxes levied on cinemas and depressing their economic viability.

rarely did films with party-political affiliation succeed in providing what critics missed in almost all Ufa productions: 'realism and a commitment to topics taken from everyday life. Such a demand, comprehensible from a critical establishment still under the impact of literary naturalism, was none the less not always compatible with the export objectives pursued by Pommer. Abroad the reality of Germany was still too much associated with the World War for subjects with contemporary setting to appeal to international audiences While before 1918 the German cinema extensively utilized locations, realistic décor, and contemporary themes, after the War it was mainly productions intended for the domestic market (comedies, social dramas, or Harry Piel adventure films) which resorted to realist settings. Most of the prestige productions that later became associated with the realism known as 'Neue Sachlichkeit' , whether those by G W Pabst (Joyless Street (Die freudlose Gasse) 1925; Die Liebe der Jeanne Ney The love of Jeanne ), 1927; Pandora's Box) Or Joe wedded to the Ufa studio look, regardless of the period in which the action was set.

THE END OF WEIMAR CINEMA

In the United States, by contrast, the complaint against German films was the absence of strong plots, clear conflicts, but, above all, the absence of stars. The star system has  always been fundamental for international filmmaking, partly because the qualities and connotations of a star transcend national boundaries in a way that setting and subject-matter often do not. One of the problems Ufa encountered in this respect was that, as soon as it developed stars, tended to be wooed to Hollywood following the example of Lubitsch's first international discovery; Pola Negri. The only truly international star in the 1920s whoalso worked in Germany was Emil Jannings, and he was indeed commanding presence in disproportionate number of Germany's American successes: Madame Dubarry; Variete, The Last Laugh, The Attempts to launch international stars by importing American actresses in the latter part of the 1920s were only   intermittently successful. Louise Brooks never became popular in the 1920s, Anna May Wong (directed by E. Dupont and Richard Eichberg) failed to catch the attention of American audiences , did American 'discovery' for May's Asphalt-develop her star potential. The cast of Murnau's Faust (1926, with Emil Jannings, Yvette Guilbert, Gösta Ekman) was deliberately international\_ but the fact that Camilla Horn was given the role of Gretchen, originally offered to Lillian Gish (to echo her success in Griffith's down   East, 1920, and Broken   Blossoms, 1919), did not help these transatlantic ambitions It is even more remarkable that none of Fritz Lang's leading men women (including Brigitte Helm) ever became an international star. When he and Pommer visited Hollywood\_ was apparently irritated by Douglas Fairbanks insisting that what mattered in American picturemaking was the performer; not the set, the orig and when importing an American director like Josef von Sternbergdid Ufa develop successful stars, such as Marlene Dietrich, Hans Albers , Lilian Harvey, Willy Fritsch, or Marika Rökk, all of them closely modelled on American stars of the early 1930s they Betty Way Lang

By that time, the fortunes of the German cinema as a nationaland internationalcinema had become even more closely allied to the of Ufa. Following severe losses in 1926 and 1927, the company's major creditor; Deutsche Bank, was prepared to force Ufa into receivership; unless thwarted in his ambitions when Ufa was first set up in 1917, seized his chance and acquired majority holdings. His new director; Ludwig Klitzsch, set about restructuring the company, following the Hollywood studio system He introduced American management principles; separating the finance department from production; reorganizing fate

distribution, and off some of the subsidiary companies. Klitzsch thus brought to Ufa the central producer duction up between different heads of   production (Produktionsleiter such as Günther Stapenhorst, Bruno Duday, and Erich Pommer) thereby   achieving both greater central control and greater division of labour. If the sealed the fate of Ufa ideologically; as most commentators have argued, it is equally true that, from a business perspective, it was thanks to Klitzsch that the first time Ufa was run strictly commercial lines. hiving for along

The Klitzsch regime allowed Ufa, with remarkable speed , to catch up with the major international develop ments, such as the introduction of sound, which the previous management had been very slow to take an interest in. Ufa converted to sound production within little more than year, while the company was also able to avoid costly competition by agreeing terms with its major domestic rival 1930-1 onwards\_ Ufa once more began to show profit, not least becauseit proved successful exporter; aggressively marketing its foreignto exploiting its gramophone and sheet music interest. However, it was not with its star directors of the 1920s that Ufa achieved financial recovery: Murnau had left for Hollywood early in 1927, Lang and Pabst were working for Seymour Nebenzahl's Nero Film, while Dupont was working in Britain, as was Carl Mayer; who after following Murnau to Hollywood had settled in London in 1931 Efficient genre directors such as Karl Hartl, Gustav Ucicky, the latter with six films, among them some of the biggest box-office successes until ('Bombs on Monte Carlo' , 1931), Einbrecher ('Burglar' 1930), Ungarische Rhapsodie Hungarian rhapsody' , 1928), and Die wunderbare der Nina Petrowna ('Nina Petrowna's wonderful lie' , 1929). Lüge

Musicals and comedies became the mainstay of the internationally minded German cinema, with super-pro ductions like Der Kongress tanzt ('The Congress Dances 1931), star vehicles like Die Drei von der Tankstelle ('Three from the petrol station 1930), screwball comedies like Viktor und Viktoria   (1933), and domestic   melodramas like Abschied ('Departure') conveying quite a different image of the German cinema from that of the 1920s\_ Even before the Nazi take over in 1933 the transformations of the industry from a twinstream entertainment were well under forced by economic necessity and technological change even more than While the migration of personnel to Hollywood, begun with Ernst

The German cinema on the eve of Hitler's rise to power confronts one with paradox: the narrative which attributes the rise of this cinema to the flourishing of talent in the creative ferment of the Weimar Republic must perforce see its cinema enter into decline; as the Republic disintegrates under the blows of the nationalist and Fascist right. The evidence, however, does not bear this out, since if decline there was, it was due to the drain of other hand, one takes performance as an indicator of success, it was only during the political upheavals of the Republic's final years that the German film industry matured into financially viable business \_ Elsewhere in Europe\_ too, the of an innovative art cinema were strictly limited; what is remarkable about the German cinema is how long these days lasted right days

## The Scandinavian Style

For a brief period after 1910,the countries of Scandinavia; despite their low population (less than 2.5 million in in 1900) and their marginal place in the western economic system played major role in the early evolution of cinema, both as an art and as an industry Their influence was concentrated into two phases: the first centred on Denmark in the four-year 1910-13, which saw the international success of the production company Nordisk Film Kompagni; and the second on Sweden between 1917 and 1923. far from consisting of an isolated blossoming of local culture, Scandinavian silent cinema was extensively years the aesthetic identity of Danish and Swedish films was intimately related to that of Russian and German cinema, each evolving in symbiotic relation to the others , linked by   complementary distribution strategies and exchanges of directors and technical expertise Within this network of cooperation only marginal role was played by the other northern European nations. Finland, did have linguistically independent cinema remained largely an adjunct of tsarist Russia until 1917.

## ORIGINS

The first display of moving pictures in Scandinavia took place in Norway on 6 April 1896 at the Variété Club in Oslo (or Christiania as it was then called) was organized by two pioneers of German cinema, the brothers Max and Emil Skladanowsky. Such was the success of their show, and of their Bioskop projection equipment; that they stayed on until Denmark, the earliest documented moving picture show was put on by the painter Vilhelm Pacht, who installed a Lumière Cinématographe in the wooden pavilion of the Raadhusplasen in Copenhagen on 7 June 1896. The equipment and the pavilion were both destroyed in a fire started by a recently sacked electrician out for revenge, but the show was relaunched on 30 June to a fanfare of publicity. Even the royal family had visited Pacht's Kinopticon on 11 June. and

The arrival of cinema in Finland followed a few weeks on from its first appearance in St Petersburg on 16 Although the Lumière Cinématographe remained in the Helsinki town hall for only eight days after opening on 28 June; owing to the high prices of seats and the relatively small size of the the photographer Karl Emil

On 1896 the Industrial Exhibition at the Summer Palace in Malmö hosted the first projection in Sweden, with Lumière material, organized by the Danish showman Harald Limkilde.

were soon supplanted by the Sklaat Djurgärten itself: these were the first moving pictures to be shot in Sweden-

## FINLAND

The first Finnish company, Pohjola;   began distributing films in 1899 under the direction of a circus impresario, J A W. Grönroos. The first location officially designated for the projection of films was the Kinematograf International, opened at the end of 1901. But, like the two other cinemas which opened shortly afterwards, it survived for only a few and it was not until theatres were definitively established on permanent basis In 1911 there were 17 cinemas in Helsinki, 81 in the rest of the country. By 1921, the figures had risen to 20 and 118 respectively. and

The first Finnish Salaviinanpolttajat Sparre assisted by Teuvo Puro an actor with Finland's National Theatre for the production company Atelier Apollo, run by Stählberg. In the following ten years, Finland produced another 27 fiction films and 312 documentary shorts, as well as two publicity films. Stählberg's near monopoly on production-between 1906and 1913 he production-was short-lived. Already in 1907 the Swede David Fernander and the Norwegian Rasmus Hallseth had produced forty-seven shorts in little more than a decade The Swedish cameraman on Salaviinanpolttajat, Frans Engström, split with Stählberg and set up-with little success \_ his own production company with the two protagonists of the flm\_ Teuvo Puro and Teppo Raikas. An extant ment of Sylvi (1913), directed by Puro, constitutes the earliest example of Finnish fiction Greater success awaited Erik Estlander; who founded Finlandia Filmi (forty-nine films between 1912 and 1916, including some shorts shot in the extreme north of the country), and the Hjalmar V. Pohjanheimo, who from 1910 onwards began to acquire several film halls, and soon turned to PrO duction\_ The films distributed by Pohjanheimo under the aegis of Lyyra Filmi were documentaries (1911) newsreels (from 1914), and comic and dramatic narratives, made and the theatrical director Kaarle Halme

The First World War brought the intervention of the Russian authorities , who in 1916 banned all cine matographic activity. The ban lapsed after the Revolution of February 1917 and was definitively removed in December when Finland declared its independence\_ The post-war period was dominated by a production company Its first important feature-length film was Anna-Liisa (Teuvo Puro and Jussi Snellman, 1922), taken from work by Minna Canth and influenced by Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness (1886): a young girl who has killed her child is overwhelmed by remorse and confesses to expiate her crime. The actor Konrad Tallroth who had already been active in Finland before the war but had then emigrated to Sweden following the banning of the film Eräs elämän murhenäytelmä (The tragedy of was taken on in 1922 by Suomi for Rakkauden kaikkivalta-Amor Omnia ( 'Love conquers all'), an uneven and isolated attempt to Finnish cinema to the mainstream features  emerging from western Europe and the United States.

Christiania Film Co. AS, set up in 1916. Before then, national production-represented by Norsk Kinematograf and Gladtvet Film-had been in an embryonic stage. Fewer than ten fiction films had been produced between 1908 and 1913, and no record exists of important productions following years\_

of silent cinema, Norway boasted no studio to speak of, and thus the affirmation of 'national style' particular to it derived in large part from the exploitation of the Nordic landscape. The first sign of the end of a semi-amateur phase in production came in directed by Rasmus Breistein. The following year saw the first important adaptation of work by Knut Hamsun, Markens (The growth of the soil' Gunnar merfeldt, 1921), but, significantly, the film was directed by Dane and photographed by a Finn, George Schnéevoigt, who was resident in Denmark at the time and who had been the cameraman for Carl Theodor Dreyer's Svenska Biografteater. Another film-Pan (Harald Schwenzen, 1922), produced by the newly formed munernes Films-Central-was also taken from a work by Hamsun period Somgrøde for Kom-

After aninterval ofa year; the first film to be considered at the time as worthy of an international audience appeared: Till Sæters (In the mountains" 1924), the first film Den   nye lensmanden ('The new commissar' produced by new company, Svalefilm, achieved equal acclaim. The brief flourishing of Norwegian silent cinema reached its with Troll-elgen ('The magic leap' Walter part due to the photography ofthe Swede Ragnar Westfelt, and with Laila (1929), dedicated to the Lapps in the north of the country. Even here however, it is worth noting the foreign input, from the Finno-Danish director Schnéevoigt to the acting of the Swedish Mona Märtenson and the Danish Peter Malberg. peak

The somewhat limited extent of Norwegian silent cinema is today represented by about thirty titles available at the Norsk Filminstitutt, Oslo

## DENMARK

On 17 September 1904 Constantin Philipsen opened the first   permanent film exhibition hall in Copenhagen. Danish fiction film production had already got under way year earlier when the photogra to the Peter Elfelt, had made Henrettelsen ('The execution'), which still survives today In 1906 an exhibitor; Ole Olsen, set up the Nordisk Film Kompagni, which was to play a fundamental role in Danish cinema throughout the silent and indeed in international cinema for part of the 1910s By 1910, Nordisk was considered the second largest production Pathé; its first studio, built by the company in 1906, is the oldest surviving film studio in the world\_ Most of staff sergeant Viggo Larsen, and shot by Axel Sørensen (renamed Axel Graatkjær after 1911). Of the 248 fiction films produced between 1903 and 1910, 242 were made by Nordisk. Only after 1909 did other companies extend the panorama of Danish cinema: Biorama of Copenhagen and Fotorama of Aarhus, both founded in 1909; and Kinografen in 1910. 'pher royal good

In 1910 a Fotorama film called Den hvide slavehandel The white slave trade') marked turning-point in the evolution of fiction films not only in Scandinavia but throughout the world. The film dealt with the theme of prostitution in previously unheard of explicit terms; and thereby inaugurated a new genre-the sensational' film\_ set in the world of crime, vice, or the circus. On the basis ('Nick Carter; Victorin Jasset, 1908), Nordisk began a series in 1910 whose protagonist was brilliant criminal Dr Gar el Hama: Eduard Schnedler Sørensen directed both Dødsflugten (UK title: The Flight from Death; US title: The Nihilist Conspiracy, 1911) and Hama II Dead Man's Child, 1912), and to some extent these films inspired the most famous films of criminal exploits; made in France by Jasset (Zigomar, 1911) and later by Louis FeuKing

Another frequent trick was to show character who was out of range of the camera's field in mirror: for example, in Ved fængslets port (Temptations of a Great City; 1911) by August Blom-starring the most famous male lead actor of the time, Valdemar Psilander--and in For äbent Tæppe Desdemona (1911). In all probability the mirror was used as an expedient to avoid the need for montages of several shots in a scene (since Danish directors seem not to have been keen on elaborate editing techniques), but the treatment of sexuality in films such as the frank and Gad (The Abyss, Kosmorama, 1910), which saw the début of the greatest actress of Danish silent film, Asta Nielsen.

sational" drama was the development of new techniques in lighting, in camera-positioning and in set design. The case of Den sorte drøm ('The black dream'), by Urban Gad (Fotorama, 1911) is particularly noteworthy in this regard. For the high anxiety of the most intense scenes, the reflectors were taken down from their usual stands and laid on the ground, so that the actors threw dark shadows on to the walls. The use of a hand-held lantern, clutched by the protagonists as struggled forward in the dark, was deployed to great effect after 1914, in Gar el Hama III: Slangøn (The Abduction; Gar el Hama's Escape From Prison, 1914) by Robert Dinesen, and in Verdens undergang (The

Early Danish film-makers paid relatively little attention to the narrative dynamic of their films: before 1914 trackshots, flashbacks, and close-ups were very rarely used. thus fell well short of the fluidity and naturalism typical of American cinema of the same period. However; the Danes had profound and lasting influence on film production on an international scale. On a general level, their most significant contribution was in the develop ment away from short-length narrative films to films of three, four; Or even more reels-August Blom's Atlantis (Nordisk, 1913), with huge budget, ran to 2,280 metres in the cultural legitimization of cinema, which was encouraged by the appearance of established actors and actresses from classical theatre ing They

Blom. Avariant on this effect was to have a character enter a dark room and turn on the light. The shooting was about to be turned on; the scene was then lit as if by the in question and shooting recommenced. Often the two segments of the shot were tinted in different colours, usually in blue for darkness and ochre for light. Another powerful effect, hardly seen outside Denmark before 1911, was the silhouette outline, shot from an interior with the lens pointing towards an open OI OI window. These ideas, which characterize two films directed by August Blom for Nordisk-Ungdommens ret (The 1911) are taken to an extreme in Det hemmelighedsfulde X the greatest Danish director of the silent period besides Carl Theodor Dreyer, Benjamin Christensen (1879-1959). developed   techniques and figures already used by the French director Léonce Perret in LEnfant de Gaumont, 1913), and arrived at extraordinary results using silhouettes and halflit images.

The first works by the Swedish directors Mauritz Stiller and Victor Sjöström technical imprint of Denmark, and only in the following two years was an autonomous identity developed in revolutionary Russia, leading some companies to shoot alternative endings designed to satisfy the Russian taste for tragic denouements. Films shot in Russia in the earlier 1910s, and especially the first dramas by Yevgeny Bauer from 1913, display techniques of lighting (back and multiple-lighting) and framing (doors and windows shot from within) which clearly derive from methods current in Danish cinema

and the markedly expressionist camera techniques (oblique halflight   effects) of   pre-1914 Danish dramas with the work of German directors such as Joe Otto Rippert, and early Fritz Lang. Vilhelm Glückstadt, whose extraordinary work as director has remained almost unexplored to this was the author expressionist aesthetic: Den fremmede ('The benefactor' , 1914); Det om enhver Enhver ('Anyone' , 1915) complex tangle of flashbacks, parallel story-lines, and strongly   metaphorical   imagery; and the  impassioned Kornspekulanten (The wheat speculators' , 1916), whose attribution to Glückstadt is not entirely certain, but which looks forwards to Carl Theodor Dreyer's Vampyr (1932).

The most lucrative   foreign market for Nordisk was Germany-at least until 1917, when the German government took control of the national film industry. Profits were so high that the company could invest in huge chain of cinemas. The close relationship between Danish and German the 1910s and 1920s becomes apparent if compares the 'sensational" themes (criminal geniuses. white slave trade, extreme passions)

Dreyer is towering figure in the pantheon of Danish cinema. His work represents the most complete synthesis of its expressionist tendencies with its meticulous rative sobriety. His interest in psychology and in the conflicts between the unconscious and the rational elements in human actions was already apparent in his first film Blade af Satans (Leaves from Satan's book, 1921), and figu bog

mission by August Strindberg to adapt his plays Miss Julie and The Father for the screen. Both appeared in 1912. The modest success of these films and the growing competition from Denmark induced the owners to transfer production to Stockholm, where a larger studio set could be built and where the chain of cinemas throughout Sweden could be better co ordinated

Magnusson demanded and was given absolute control over the move\_ He planned the new studios at Lidingö, near Kyrkviken, and acquired the support of a group of artists and technicians who were to define the course of silent cinema in Sweden: Julius Jaenzon; appointed chief cameraman and director of the studios at Lidingö; Georg af head of production and director; Victor Sjöström, the best director on the market today' accordto the magazine Scenisk Konst, 6-7 April 1912; and Mauritz Stiller; a Russian ~Jewish theatre actor and director whose uneven stage career had led him back and forth between Sweden and Finland for many years \_ Magnusson himself directed a number of films between 1909 and 1912, but he soon settled into role as producer-patron, offering his formidable intuition and energy in support of the most risky ideas put to him by his   directors, but also ensuring the collaboration of high-calibre intellectuals, such as Selma Lagerlöf, whose novels 1919 new young on the scene and engineered the merger of a new company; Svenska Filmindustri\_ New studios were built, new cinemas were opened, and old ones restored By 1920 Svenska Filmindustri had become a world power; with subsidiaries across the globe. The 'golden age' of Swedish cinema, stretching from 1916 to 1921, was in time when almost all the other great film industries in Europe (including that of Denmark) were threatened by embargoes and serious financial difficulties, continued to export films without hindrance; and, by the same token, took full   advantage of the drastic reduction in imports. However;, even these favourable conditions would have had little impact were it not for the creative contribution of a number of exceptionally ing

Mauritz Stiller (1883-1928) specialized in comedies with carefully controlled paceanda subtle vein ofsocialsatire which verged on the burlesque; in which the construction and articulation of events took precedence over psycho logical analysis and description. Two typical examples of his style are 'The modern suffragette 1913) and Kärlek och journalistik Love bästa film (Wanted: A Film Actress, 1917) and Thomas Graals bästa barn (Marriage à la mode, 1918) to a set of 'moral tales marked by disillusioned perspective on the precarious nature of relations between the sexes and on the inconstancy of passion. This tendency in Stiller's work reached of cynicism and disrespect in Erotikon (Just like Man; also known as After We are Married or Bonds that Cheat, 1920), but is offset at the turn ofthe decade by his growing penchant for treatments of themes such as ambition and guilt. Herr Arnes pengar (UK title: Snows of Destiny; US title Berling, 1923), both taken from novels by Selma Lagerlöf; elaborate such themes with a figurative intensity and epic energy which no director in Europe had thus far achieved. saga also introduced talented actress, Greta Garbo, whose inseparable companion and mentor Stiller was to become. Invited to Hollywood by Louis B. Mayer, Stiller insisted on bringing Garbo with him; but whereas their departure from Sweden was the coincided with a creative crisis from which he never recovered peak

The chronological order-before   Stiller and Sjöström joined Svenska   Biografteatern-was Georg af Klercker; whose films are characterized by an extreme meticulous attention to acting, and by a restrained and rigorous reinterpretation of the canons of bourgeois drama, social realism, and the 'circus genre, initiated in Denmark by Robert Dinesen and Alfred Lind with the seminal De fire djævle ('The four devils' , Kinografen, 1911) and characterized by sentimental plots , spectacular clashes , and vendettas

amongst riders and kuskupolen (The Last Performance 1912), the company's first international success, Klercker moved briefly to Denmark. He returned to Sweden on the invitation of a new company, F. V Hasselblad Fotografiska AB of Götfor whom he directed twenty-eight films between 1915 and 1917. One of the best was Förstadtprästen ('The suburban vicar' 1917), the story of priest working to help society's rejects, filmed on location in the pOor districts of Göteborg .

With the departure to America of Sjöström (1923), Stiller and Garbo (1925), the actor Lars Hanson, and the Danish director Benjamin Christensen who had made his most ambitious film in Sweden, the perturbing documentary drama Häxan (Witchcraft through the Ages; 1921), Swedish cinema entered phase of steep decline. Instead of deciding on renewal of the themes and styles which had brought them such glory, directors of not negligible talent such as Gustaf Molander, John W.

Original as it may seem in style and subject-matter; film production in Russia   started as an offshoot of international trade.

appeared when the distribution system was fully estab lished on the Russian film market. Combining production with distribution in this way was the only hope of success for film-producing company in Russia in the 1910s. A vertically semi-integrated system allowed Russian studios to invest the money they earned from distributing foreign films into native productions-a system that would be used, with variable success, by the stockholding company Sovkino in the mid-1920s.

With the notable  exception of the exphotographer Alexander Drankov; the importer was the key to the first production companies in Russia. The importer was between linking film producers and local exhibitors; the more companies an importer was able to enlist, the more chances he had to launch his own production Alexander Khanzhonkov's production company started as a small commission agency selling films and projection equipment manufactured Urban, Hepworth, Bioscope and Itala Film. Companies Vitagraph were represented by Pavel Thiemann, another powerful figure in the prerevolutionary film industry Because it took a lot of travelling between Russia and the exporting countries, the share of early American films on the Russian market was relatively small. Pathé-Frères preferred to send their own representatives engaged in or pro but on a more modest scale. foreign

Around 1906-7, film theatres in Moscow and St Petersburg started renting used prints to the provinces, and the system ofimporters purchasing films from production companies to resell to exhibitors began to be replaced.

Two types of strategy-disruptive and competitive~were employed by studios competing for the Russian market Disruption (sryv) was notorious gimmick whereby competitor's production was undermined by cheaper (and sloppier) version of the same subject (story; title) released earlier or on the same Borrowed from the theatre entrepreneur F. Korsh (who used the method to rob competitors' first productions of their novelty value) Perski in order to tempt regional renting agencies with a low-price alternative to Khanzhonkov's or Pathé's hits. This policy achieved little beyond hectic production races and a pervasive atmosphere of paranoid secrecy; Distinct from disruption, strategy of competition (developed by studios with solid financial backing: first Khanzhonkov, Pathé-Frères , Thiemann, and Reinhardt, later Yermoliev and Kharitonov) consisted of promoting the idea of 'quality pictures and turning a recognizable studio style into a marketable value day. try

## CINEMA AND THE REVOLUTION

when Lenin signed the Council of People's Commissars of trade and industry to Narkompros [The People's Commissariat of Education] , nationalizing private film and photographic enterprises. But the struggle for power in film had already begun in 1917, when film workers banded

together in three professional organizations: the OKO (a federation of distributors , exhibitors, and producers); the Union of Workers in Cinematographic Art   (creative workers--the 'film aristocracy'); and the Union of Filmprojectionists) The last workers control over cinemas and film enterprises, soon came to determine the line taken by the Moscow and Petrograd

Cinema Committees, which had been set up in 1918 and had already begun nationalizing parts of the film indusof 1918 the Petrograd Committee had nationalized sixty-four non-functioning cinemas and two film studios abandoned by their previous owners, whilein Moscow, where most film enterprises were concentrated, process of nationalization was carried out between November 1918 and January 1920.

The process of restructuring continued throughout the 1920s The former Khanzhonkov and Yermoliev studios were merged in 1924, then in 1927 construction began in the village of Potylikha outside Moscow of new premises for this studio, which it was decided should become the largest in the country. Construction continued until the studio became known as Mosfilm.

In this early only large companies were subject to nationalization, and the biggest film studio (that of the Khanzhonkov Company) had no more than 100 people on its staff, so during the first years of Soviet cinema private and state film   companies coexisted Certain pre-revolutionary film companies (Drankov, Perski, Vengerov; and Khimera) went out of business even before nationfore laid by half film enterprises, which after nationalization came under the Photography and Film section of Narkompros.  These were the former Khanzhonkov studio (which became First Enterprise 'Goskino') studios also began to be constructed, of which the first was Sevzapkino in Petrograd (later Leningrad) phase

Meanwhile private companies subsisted. The most resilient private owners adopted parallel policy of merging studios sometimes handing over to Soviet power in so doing an element of their financial autonomy; sometimes acquiring it in a new form A owner of Rus film enterprise; which had been in existence since 1915 with the film bureau Mezhrabpom and formed the company known as MezhrabpomRus , was reorganized in 1926 as joint-stock company Two years later it changed the composition ofits shareholders and reorganized itself again as MezhrabpomFilm, becoming part of the German distribution organization Prometheus and obtaining from the Council of People's Commissars special rights to export and import films. In this Mezhrabpom was to play a central role in the diffusion of Soviet film in the west\_ guise

Pressure from film workers also continued to play a role in shaping the new situation. In 1924 a group of filmmakers, led by Sergei Eisenstein and Lev Kuleshov; came together in Moscow to form the Association of Rev-

olutionary Cinematography (ARC) The objective of ARC (whose members came to include Vsevolod Pudovkin, Dziga Vertov; Grigory Kozintsev; Leonid Trauberg; Georgi Friedrich Ermler, Esfir Shub, and many other leading film-makers) was to reinforce ideological control over the creative process Branches the organization had its own publications; including the ekran and Kino i kultura. In 1929 ARC was renamed ARRC (Association of Workers of Revolutionary Cinematograof Proletarian Writers (RAPP) had strong influence on ARRC, and a new aim was adopted of 100 per cent proletarian ideological film' as part of the 'cultural revolution imposed throughout the arts. being

It was not before the aim of concentrating and centralizing film production in order to bring the cinema under social and state control led to the idea of establishing single national film industry The first in this direction came with thecreation in December 1922 of the film enterprise Goskino, which was given a monopoly to be a useless bureaucracy; and it was axed at the Twelfth Party Congress. A commission was set up to consider ways of 'uniting the film industry on an all-Union basis' merging all state film enterprises in each of the Union republics in single joint-stock society. The Thirteenth Party Congress in 1924 confirmed this direction adding the demand for reinforced ideological monitoring in film-making and the appointment of 'tested Communists' to senior   positions in the industry From Russian Federation, while similar organizations were set up in the Union republics\_VUFKU in the Ukraine, AFKU in Azerbaijan; Bukhkino in Central Asia, and Goskinprom in Georgia. Sovkino and its clones had a full monopoly of took over production functions as well. Although it managed to lose Sovkino system survived to the end of the decade without significant alteration and provided the infrastructure for the great Soviet films of the late silent period. long step May

During the 1920s regional studios came into being in the republics of the newly formed USSR-in the Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and elsewhere\_ The aim of these studios was to produce films relating to the local nationality in those areas, and they enjoyed certain measure of autonomy.

Also in France were the Russian-Polish animator Starewicz (in French Ladislas at Fontenay-sous-Bois, and the producer Pavel Thiemann, who settled at Joinville.

In Czechoslovakia the Russian diasand others, joined later in the decade by the famous Soviet actress Vera Baranovskaya, who moved to Prague and established a new reputation for herself there.

Hollywood became a centre of Russian film émigrés in the second half of the 1920s.

This may take the form of hallucinations, as in Tourjansky's Song of Triumphant Love, or delirium, as however; it is represented as dream-as in Angoissante Aventure ('Dreadful adventure' , 1920) Or Mosjoukine's Le Brasier ardent ( 'The burning brazier' , 1923)and is used by the émigrés as persistent metaphor of their post-revolutionary existence as something temporary and tranone of the major canons of the pre-revolutionary film is obligatory tragic finale, or 'Russian ending'\_ For western audiences such an ending was acceptable only in the case of the classic melodrama, such Kean, ou désordre et génie ('Kean, or disorder and genius' , 1923). Increasingly the émigré film-makers were forced to to varying degrees in different countries. Hollywood categorically demanded happy ending. For example, Dimitri Buchowetzki, working in 1925 on film version of Anna Karenina, felt obliged to prepare a version of the screenplay in which Anna turns out to have thrown herself under the train only in dream and in actual fact she marries Vronsky. In after a longer struggle. Distortion of the Russian classics was seen as sacrilege, which was only conceded in the of Pushkin's story 'The Stationmaster' (under the title Nostalgie) in 1937.More often a compromise was reached. For example, in of Triumphant Love, Turgenev's story is simply left incomplete; it breaks off on happy note, creating for western filmgoers the sensation of happy ending, while directing Russians to the mystical tragic finale ofthe literary source end tacked on to the 'Russian finale so that in Angoissante Aventure the hero is shown awakening from nightmare, while in Chopin's Fifteenth Prelude the heroine's suicide is forestalled by chance\_ Song

Wedded as a conservative consciousness , and unwilling to give up the traditions of pre-revolutionary cinema with its slowed-down rhythm and pace of action, the émigrés showed themselves unreceptive to the avant-garde experiment that typified western cinema of the 1920s, particularly in France. The only exception was Mosjoukine's Le Brasier ardent, which in this respect sets itself apart from the rest of émigré cinema. The traditional approach, the lack of interest in experiment with montage, the centrality of the actor; all distinguish the style of   émigré cinema its contemporary Soviet counterpart in the 1920s.Itis significant that, according to contemporary   testimony, Le Brasier they from

With this experiment Kuleshov sought to confirm one of the laws of montage that he had discovered: that the meaning of a montage sequence in cinema is determined not by the content of the montage elements , but by their juxtaposition. This experiment, known in the west from the lecture 'Model instead of actor' given in London by Vse volod Pudovkin in 1929 (and therefore often incorrectly referred to as the Pudovkin effect) was sometimes seen by contemporaries not as manifestation of the avantgarde thinking of the new epoch, but as evidence of the vandalism of the Soviet cinema towards its predecessors Thus Moisei Aleinikov (head of the Rus film studio and later of Mezhrabpom-Film) describes in his memoirs how Kuleshov's 'montage people' , wearing leather jackets and carrying revolvers, used to arrest old film negatives in the studio, in order to reedit this 'rubbish filmed by the bourgeoisie' into new revolutionary film-there being

The Iron Five (G V Alexandrov, M. Shtraukh, A. Levshin, M. A A. Antonov) came into in 1923 In his very first theoretical work Eisenstein proposed replacing the plot in the cinema by a montage of attractions; and in his first the masses as hero as an alternative to the Russian pre revolutionary and contemporary western system of stars. The frame for Eisenstein was an independently significant unit of montage, an 'attraction'-that is, audience's perception-and the 'montage of attractions was a sequence ofshocks having an effect on the spectator and provoking response reaction in such creatively productive way that the spectator became, as it were; the director's coauthor in creating the film text. Herein the chief difference between Eisenstein's concept of montage and that of Kuleshov; within whose system the spectator was allotted passive role and was simply the to Kule shov's theory the role of the frame in a montage sequence was equivalent to that of the letter in not the content of each frame which was significant but their juxtaposition being lay

Eisenstein was indebted to Kuleshov for the idea itself of the frame as a unit of montage. According to the recollections of eyewitnesses , Eisenstein learnt to construct mass scenes from the example of Kuleshov's The Death (Luch smerti, 1925). He also acknowledged his indebtedness to the reediting school, mainly via the reediting of foreign films for Soviet distribution, in which he was that it was suggested to Eisenstein by their show The Marriage, which represented a sequence of attractions\_ Eisenstein first combined into montage series in his stage production of The Wise Man in 1923 Ray

FEX (The Factory ofthe Eccentric Actor) came into in Leningrad under the leadership of Grigory Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg in 1921 as a theatrical workshop and from 1924 became a cinematographic collective The emphasis on eccentrism' put forward by FEX testified on the one hand to their orientation towards 'low' (circus vaudeville; the variety stage) and their rejection On the being genres

Also based in Leningrad was rival group, KEM (Experimental Cinema Workshop) led by Friedrich Ermler; Edward Johanson, and Sergei Vasiliev. Unlike FEX, KEM was purely film group. Rejecting the Stanislavsky system, it modelled itself on the ideas of Vsevolod erhold, stressing professionalism above inspiration in the actor's Ermler declared\_ 'the actor and not the frame makes films' but this provocative statement was belied by his own formally subtle Oblomok   imperii ( 'Fragment of an empire' , 1929).

What united all tendencies was a shared cult of Charlie as Alexei Gan and Dziga revolutionary tradition. For the FEX group, he was the wrote of the 'attractional qualities of the specific mechanics of [Chaplin's] movements'\_ For Kuleshov as well as for the FEXes, he was the embodiment of America.

This idea of the film author as demiurge was shared by other film-makers In his 1923 manifesto Dziga Vertov of the ability of the 'kino eye to put together in montage person 'more perfect than the creation of Adam' while Kozintsev and Trauberg in their unfilmed scenario Zhenshchina Edisona   ('Edison's 1923) envisaged the creation of new Eve, the daughter of Edison and the primogenitrix of the new world spoke

Parallel with the avant-garde tendency, an academic and tised largely by directors such as A. Ivanovsky; C. Sabinsky, and P. Chardynin who had already been working in Russia before the Revolution. Needless to say, this cinema was not entirely conservative\_ Rather it tended to mix traditional technique with artificially introduced 'revolutionary' subject-matter. An interesting example of this is Gardin's Prizrak brodit po Yevropie spectre is haunting Europe' , Red Death' , this film has a subtly conceived montage but

fusion of new techniques, to some degree transcending the polemics over the 'played' and 'unplayed 'historical revolutionary epic' . Films in this category were distinguished by non-traditional plot structure and narration; intensive montage, and rich use of metaphor and experiments in film language, while fulfilling a social and ideological requirement by their treatment of revolutionary themes. They include such classics as EisenThe Battleship Potemkin (Bronenosets Petersburg (Koniets Sankt-Peterburga, 1927), and The Heir of Genghis Khan (Potomok Chingis-Khana, 1928-also known as Storm (1927) and Arsenal (1929).

SVD had as script-writers the formalist theoreticians Yuri Tynyanov and Yuli Oksman, and from 1926 the Soviet silent cinema enters what Eisenstein was to call its 'second literary Intense debates took place about the role of the scenario. At one extreme were Vertov; who rejected the idea of the played film entirely; and the writer Osip Brik, who went so far as to propose writing the scenario Sokolov and the proponents of the 'iron scenario' in which every shot was numbered and pre-planned in advance Against the iron scenario, Eisenstein proposed an 'emotional scenario 'stenographic record of the impulse' , which would assist the director in finding visual incarnation for the idea period' .

On the whole the intervention of the formalist writers and critics led to at least a partial reintegration of literary values into Soviet cinema\_ This is evident in Tynyanov's script for The Overcoat (Shiniel, 1926), adapted from Gogol and directed by   Kozintsev and Trauberg, Shklovsky' s for Kuleshov's By the Law (Po zakonu; 1926), based on Jack London's story 'The Unexpected' .

The everyday genre with its interest in the detail of surrounding reality; including industry; gradually began to occupy dominating position in Soviet cinema, with (The whirlpool') and Ermler's Dom sugrobakh ('The house in the snowdrifts Everyday life is also central to the comedies of Boris na Trubnoi 1928) where it merges with another important trend in counterpoising of the and the provinces, with the city as a new world opening up before the new arrival from the provinces , as in Ermler's Katka bumazhny ranet ('Katya's reinette apples'), Room's Vbolshom gorodie ('In the city') Y Zhelyabuzhsky's V gorod vkhodit ('No to the city'), and also Pudovkin's The End of St Petersburg: city= big nelzya entry

By the end of the decade a contradictory situation had arisen in Soviet cinema. The montage cinema had reached peak, Or rather several peaks, since there were divergent tendencies within it. On the one side was the of intellectual cinema, which Eisenstein had   begun to develop at the time when he was working on October (Oktyabr, 1927), and which took definitive in 1929 with his article The Fourth Dimension in the Cinema And on the other side stood the so-called 'lyrical' or functioning through image-symbols and Arsenal (1929), Nikolai Shengelai's Elisso (1928) and Yevgeni Chervyakov's Girl from under the influence of Eisenstein's article on the Fourth Dimension, he and Kozintsev completely altered the montage principle of their film New Babylon (Novy Vavilon, 1929) abandoning 'linkage of the action in plot develop ment in favour of what Eisenstein called the 'conflicting combination of overtones of the intellectual order' then saw Pudovkin's freshly released ersburg, which stood at the midway point between the intellectual and emotional poles, and under its influence theory shape garde.

## Yiddish Cinema in Europe

No panorama of early European cinema can be complete without mention of the unique phenomenon ofthe transnational Yiddish cinema, which flourished in eastern and central Europe throughout the silent period and into the 1930s. This Yiddish cinema derived from the extra-territorial tradition of European Jewish culture and literature rooted in the Yiddish language. Yiddish is a language and rich vocabulary; which by the turn ofthe century had become the mother tongue of over 10 million Jews, living mostly in central and eastern Europe but also as part of ina, and elsewhere in the New World.

## THE YIDDISH CULTURAL TRADITION

Throughout eastern and central Europe Yiddish had full-fledged literature; comparable with other European national literatures. Alongside élite works aspiring to the printed in instalments in cheap pamphlet form. Leading representatives of Yiddish literature at the turn of the century include Avrom Goldfadn, father of the Jewish theatre Yankev An-ski (Shloyme Zaynvil Rapoport), Yitskhok Leyb Perets, Sholem Ash, Yoysef toshu (Yoysef Meyer tovski), and Sholem Aleykhem (Sholem Rabinowicz), and it was often to the works of Opa-

these authors that the nascent Yiddish cinema turned for inspiration in the 1910s and 1920s.

Yiddish  cinema has its drama and theatre of the late nineteenth and early twentieth cen-turies\_ stemming from the tradition of the Purim-Shpil and   incorporating elements of the so called 'shundroman popular fiction. It was in 1892 that the actress Ester Rokhl Kaminska, 'the Jewish Eleonora Duse' , first appeared in the Eldorado theatre in Warsaw. By 1911 three Jewish theatres were open in that Troupe at the Dynasy, the Elizeum, and the Orion while the famous Vilner   troupe was started in Vilna (now Vilnius) by Mordkhe Mazo in 1916. In 1918, on the other side of the Atlantic, Yankev (acob) Ben-Ami, together with Moris Shvarts founded the even more famous Yiddish Arts Theatre in New York city:

The Yiddish theatrical repertory consisted of biblical Scenes generating a religious aura were often interwoven with Their changing   atmosphere betrayed permanent sense and combined drama and tragedy with tearful, melodramatic scenes and devastating wit that triggered off contagious laughter: The   performances owed their unique character and expressiveness to their (sometimes satirical) borrowing from Hasidic tradition; and Yiddish theatrical plays and films cannot be fully understood without reference to eastern European Hasidism; with its own specific brand themes ofindividual Romantic rebellion of the individual and the conflict of tradition and assimilation.

## SILENT FILM

From the outset Yiddish films enjoyed considerable popunot only with Jewish audiences but among spectators of other nationalities in search of the exotic were made in Poland, Russia, Austria, Germany; Czechoslovakia, and Romania. In Russia were produced by the S. Mintus Company in Riga (Latvia) the Mizrakh and Mirograf Company in Odessa, and by the Kharitonov; Khanzhonkov; and Pathé production companies in Moscow; and elsewhere. But the majority originated from Poland, whose Jews, characterized by a particularly strong century, more than 80 per cent of the more than 400,000of Warsaw spoke and read Yiddish. larity They they

was Warsaw, where the first production company; Sila, was founded by Mordkhe (Mordka) Towbin. Among the films produced by Sila before the outbreak of the First World War were four adapted from plays by leading Yiddish playwright Yankev (Jacob) Gordin, starting in 1911

with Der vilder Foter (The Cruel Father) with Herman Sieracki in the title-role and Zina Goldshteyn in the role of the daughter. Sila also engaged the services of members of the theatrical Kaminski family. Avrom Yitskhok Kaminski directed Destitute Murder (1911) and the mystical drama by Andrzej Marek (Marek   Arnshteyn OI Orenshteyn) starred both Ester Rokhl Kaminska and Ida Kaminska, who made her début in the role of the boy Shloymele.

In 1913 dynamic new Yiddish film enterprise called Kosmofilm was founded in Warsaw by Shmuel Ginzberg and Henryk Finkelstein. In 1913-14 Kosmofilm produced screenings of further plays by Gordin: Der Umbakanter (Love Khagzns Tokhter (The Cantor's Daughter), and Di Shkhite, and filmed by Sila a couple of years earlier. The film to be made by Kosmofilm with captions in Yiddish before the German invasion of Warsaw on 5 August 1915 was Di farshtoysene Tokhter (The Repudiated Daughter) , based on the play by Avrom Goldfadn, with the participation of Ester Rokhl Kaminska. last

Jewish themes also attracted the attention of filmmakers in Germany before and during the First World War.

Three outstanding Yiddish films made in Poland in the 1920s were: Tkies Kaf (The Oath, 1924) directed by Zygmunt Turkow; Der Lamedvovnik (One of the Thirty-six, 1925) by Henryk Szaro; and In Poylishe Velder (In Polish Woods, 1929), directed by selling novel of the same title; with both Polish and Jewish teenth-century Poland and participation alongside the Poles in Russia\_ on the famous Menakhem-Mendl story-cycle by Sholem khem, and was made with the participation of actors from the Habima Theatre and the great Soviet Yiddish actor Shloyme Mikhoels Blondzhende  Shtern (Wandering Stars, abouta Jewish who runs away the parental home and years later becomes famous violinist.

These fake documentaries ofthe Russo-Japanese War drew audiences' attention to the differences between fiction and non-fiction films, distinction that had not been visible in the Japanese film industry up until that point.

Following the tradition of the magic lantern show; or utsushie, early films were shown at variety halls, rental halls, OI ordinary theatres, alongside presentations in different media. Many of the first Japanese films recorded scenes from kabuki: in 1899, Momijigari ('Viewing scarlet maple leaves and Ninín   Dojoji ('Two people at Dojo temple') were filmed by Tsunekichi Shibata, and Tsuneji Tsuchiya made Nío no ukisu ('The floating nest of the little V, consisted of three shots and already showed a primitive form of film narrativity. Ninin Dojoji was the first tinted film ever made in Japan. It was coloured by the Yoshizawa Company; manufacturers of magic lantern apparatus and slides, who later became one of the first Japanese film at the kabuki theatre in August 1900, the sponsor created mock-up of a valley in front of the screen, with a fishfilled pond between the rocks, and a cool breeze generated by an electric fan wafting over the audience. Such extrafilmic devices were an important feature of early Japanese cinema

In addition to the Konishi Photographic Store, Asanuma & Co. and Tsurubuchi Photographic Store dabbled with film production at the turn of the century; but soon turned exclusively to the sale of film stock and equipment. Japanese audiences were hungry for domestic subjects, but even as late as 1904 there were no production companies to fulfil their needs. The Komatsu Company, established in 1903, made some subjects for travelling exhibitions in the but even Yoshizawa Company, the most active, filmed only news subjects, landfrom France, still dominated the market.

Until 1908 there was no flm studio in Japan, and all films were shot in the open air, including the kabuki films that required painted backdrops. However; after visiting the Edison studio in the USA, Kenichi Kawaura, the head of Yoshizawa Company, built glass studio in Meguro, Tokyo; completed in January 1908.Soon afterwards, Pathé followed suit in Kyoto, and a year later the Fukuhodo Company started film-making in the Hanamidera studio, also in Tokyo. From 1909, then, systematic film-making, companies formed the mainstream of that production in

In October 1903 Japan's first cinema (Denki-kan or Electric Theatre) was established in Asakusa, Tokyo, and from this point the number of cinemas gradually increased, slowly replacing the vaudeville halls . The Japanese developed unique way of showing films, borrowed from the traditions of the staged kabuki and Noh, which lasted throughout the silent period; a benshi, who explained the filmic   image to the audiences, attended each per formance. In the primitive era introduced the films and told their outlines to the audience before the show complex, the benshi explained the scenes and spoke the music, while the or sometimes several players narrating from outside the filmic   image prevented Japanese cinema's complete assimilation to the The narrative function of the intertitles and the shot organization tended to be simplified as much as possible to emphasize the skill of the benshi in describing the narthey

the atmosphere, and the feelings of the characters. There were few intertitles in Japanese films even in the late 1910s, and in most cases functioned only as captions to each chapter of the story. Similarly; the dominance of the benshi's voice obliged the exclusion of the short take and any rapid action by the actors . By the 1910s, the popularity of the benshi became so enormous that exerted as much power over the finished look of a film as any of they they

This is not to say. however, that Japanese films did not adopt any western influences By 1912, inspired by the French films that flooded the domestic market, the power ful Yoshizawa Company was making dramas with contemporary subjects (known as diverse genres such similarities with western cinema were Japanese films preserved a unique flavour throughout the 1910s. The existence of the benshi as a narrator 'outside' the film meant that the primary purpose of the mise-enscène ofJapanese cinema was representing the characters' interactions and changes of feeling and mood within each scene, rather than constructing an illusion of a smoothly developing story There were some attempt to assimilate western filmic forms into early Japanese film; Shin hototogisu Pathé, 1909), directed by Shisetsu Iwafuji, used flashbacks, and Matsu no midori 'The green of the pine' , Yoshizawa, 1911) used as the climax of the narrative. Even these works, however; adopted the traditional theatrical rule that the female role was to be played by an oyama; the special male actor who always played the women's roles. Until the early 1920s, there were very few actresses in Japanese cinema, because it was believed that femininity could be rendered more effectively by an oyama than by a real woman.

In 1912, aiming to monopolize the market, Yoshizawa, Yokota, Pathé and Fukuhodo consolidated into the trust Nippon Katsudoshashin Co. (Nikkatsu) This company built the Mukojima studio in Tokyo, where produced scores of temporary subjects, often adapted from newspaper serials Or foreign fiction; in a melodramatic style In Kyoto they used the former Yokota studio; and produced Kyuha (Old School) films; samurai films with historical backgrounds. As soon as Nikkatsu was established , several anti-trust companies were also formed Among them, Tenkatsu established in March 1914, became the most competitive absorbed into Nikkatsu, Fukuhodo had bought the rights to Charles Urban's Kine macolor for the purposeof 'releasing Urban 's Kinemacolor films and producing Japanese films shot by the process Taking over was established to make Kinemacolor films to compete with Nikkatsu films\_ they being

Tenkatsu, who imitated Nikkatsu by making both Old School and New School films, also produced rensageki, or chain drama, combination of stage play and cinema using films for the scenes that were difficult to represent live on the stage. The live action and filmic images alternated in 'chain' fashion After one scene was the next scene was projected on to it for several minutes, and then the actors played on the stage again. Tenkatsu was unusual in employing actresses for these films as early as 1914.

The distinction between the Old School and New School was borrowed from the concept of genre chiefly estabwhich was later called jidaigeki (period drama) was conin historical costume appeared, set in the periods before the Meiji restoration. The School which was later called gendaigeki (modern drama) consisted of films set in contemporary circumstances. The Old School was always based around superstar: Matsunosuke Onoe was Nikkatsu's most   famous star; while Tenkatsu had the very popular Shirogoro Sawamura. The cinema of stars was thus established first and foremost by the period drama in Japan. In such films, stereotyped stories were repeated and again, played by the same actors \_ This tradition of repetition became one of the most particular traits in the history of Japanese cinema. Such stories as Chushingura ('The loyal forty-seven retainers have been made many times and continue to be made to this New again and

Masao Inoue's Taii no musume ('The daughter of the lieutenant' , 1917), made at the newly established Kobayashi Co. was quite different from the traditional New School films in using westernized techniques. Adapted Taii no musume was inspired by its stylistically static direction, but Masao Inoue used flashback that the German film had not, and utilized close-ups that were unusual in

Japanese cinema at the time In the when the filmic image was for the most part constituted as illustration for the benshi's vocal skills, Inoue showed the rhetorical sense in the picture itself. The image of the bride's trousseau being carried for the wedding ceremony is reflected on the surface of river, while the camera westernized direction was rare in Japanese cinema even in 1917.Inoue used close-ups in his next film Dokuso ('The poisonous herb' , 1917), but in most Japanese films of this period, where oyama still played the female roles, the was not effective period again

There had been partial and sporadic attempts to westernize Japanese cinema even before 1910 For example; in the Yoshizawa Company's comedy films, which were heavily influenced by French cinema, the main actor was some companies attempted to change the highly codified organization of primitive Japanese cinema into the constitution of westernized reality; incorporating realist setmove away from stereotyped subjects. This was also the when the role of director attained a new importance. In 1918 directors like Eizo Tanaka and Tadashi Oguchi made changes tings, period

In Japanese arts in the post-Meiji period, artistic ambition was widely conJapan could be made highbrow by conforming to the norms of western art. The westernization of style was easier in modern drama than in period drama, and so it was that the developments took place. here

Kaeriyama asserted cinema which was only the illustration of the benshi's voice impermatically formed by the filmic image, as seen in the dominant form of European and American cinema In 1918, when Nikkatsu allowed Eizo Tanaka and Tadashi Oguchi to make westernized films on this principle; Tenidea of the 'pure film no kagayaki ('The glow of life' ) and Miyama no otome ('Maid of the mountains' both 1918). These films were set in imaginary highly codified comportment of the actors employed in traditional Japanese cinema, and manufacturing naturalism that was in complete opposition to the prevalent deep

In this short period; two ephemeral companies made two was Kokkatsu, which absorbed Tenkatsu in 1920 and gave Norimasa Kaeriyama the opportunity to make films. This company not only produced period dramas directed by Jiro Yoshino of oyama. It allowed some directors to experiment with Ryoha Hatanaka; 1921), or films which partially employed expressionist settings, for example Reiko no wakare ('On the verge of spiritual light' , Kiyomatsu Hosoyama, 1922).

Slowly other film companies took up this trend, and by the early 1920s the traditional form of Japanese cinema had become completely old-fashioned. The between 1920 and the first half of 1923 (just before the Great Kanto Earthquake) witnessed change of form in Japanese cinema. The New School became established as modern drama, and the Old School as the period drama\_ There was transition from the traditional theatrical form to the studio system, and film style, as well as the production process, began to follow the western model. The earliest form ofJapanese cinema, which avoided rapid changes of images, used intertitles only for the chapters of a story; or used filmic images for discrete segments of stage play as seen in the chain drama, was obliged to change in this period, even within the most conservative The company resisted assimilating to the western form for a long time and attempted changing demands prompted change in company policy period

A shot from Daisuke Ito's recently rediscovered masterpiece

The Taikatsu Company was established to produce intellectual films. This company did not, unlike Nikkatsu and Kokkatsu, draw the audience in by making Old School sword-play films with popular stars, and neither was the company interested in the already codified form of New School films. Taikatsu's intention was to produce cinematic Japanese films inspired by, but not directly imitating, European and American cinema. For this purpose, the company invited Junichiro Tanizaki to betheir adviser. Their first production was The Amateur Club (Kisaburo Kuri hara, 1920), in which elements of American bathing beauties chase scenes, slapstick\_were adapted to Japanese circumstances , attaining a visual dynamism absent from other traditional Japanese films of the time This was one of the first Americanized films produced in Japan, and its director; Kurihara, went on to make Katsushika sunago (1921), Hinamatsuri no yoru (The night of the dolls' 1921), and Jyasei  no in (The lasciviousness of the viper' , 1921) at Taikatsu and expand this aesthetic .

The early 1920s also saw the establishment of Shochiku Kinema, company which   relinquished archaic making from the outset, and introduced American fordirection. Shochiku used actresses who adopted facial expressions found in American films in order to represent psychological complexity; and tried to render the more natural movement ofthe everyday world\_ Shochiku built a studio in Kamata, Tokyo, immediately began to produce Americanized films under the advice of George Chapman and Henry Kotani from Hollywood studios . The tendency to   represent the blatant desire to rebuff the traditional Japanese style\_ were the hallmarks of the Shochiku films. The forthright Americanism of the studio was decried by critics at first, cinema as whole assimilated a studio system based on the model of the United States\_ and

In 1920 such American methods making would still have seemed strange to the audiences, but the situation changed rapidly; and the system was transformed virtually within At Shochiku, Kaoru making, supervising the revolutionary Rojo no reikon Soul on the road' , Minoru Murata, 1921), the very apotheosis ofthe studio's desire to produce a new Japanese aesthetic. In this film, plural stories were narrated in parallel, a new practice; inspired by D W. Griffith's Intolerance (1916). By this time even Nikkatsu, which had been making the most traditional films could not resist the current. In January 1921 the company founded special section for intelfilm-making, dominated by the director Eizo Tanaka, who made three films that year: Asahi sasu mae ('Before the morning sun shines'), Shirayuri no kaori ('Scent year

of the white lily' ) and Nagareyuku onna ('Woman in the stream') . These were, for Nikkatsu, attempts at innovation were released in theatres that specialized in screenforeign films to an intellectual audience Their intertitles were written in both Japanese and English. The New School films employed several benshi and the intertitles were traditionally felt to disturb the benshi , so Nikkatsu inserted bilingual intertitles into these 'intellectual' films to avoid the resistance of the traditional film fans and to establish an affinity with the similarly titled foreign films They ing flow

Nevertheless, as the acting style in these films remained traditional, the attempts at innovation were not wholly successful, especially in the face of competition from Sho chiku. Although Tanaka's films did feature actresses, in the main Nikkatsu, the last film company to give up the

So, despite this general shift towards westernized cineabandoned. Indeed in 1922 Eizo Tanaka made the masterpiece Kyoya erimise ('Kyoya, the collar shop') employing oyama. Unlike the contemporary directors at Shochiku, Tanaka did not simply follow American cinematic trends. This was film about an old collar shop, Kyoya, in which the downfall of one family; and, by implication, of old Japan, is described through the passing of the four The distinction of the seasons in this flm corresponds to seasonal words in haiku, traditional Japanese poetry; which, added to the poetic background and atmosform of Japanese traditional art achieved by the cinema to date. As one of the last Nikkatsu films that employed oyama, Kyoya erimise was the final swan-song of archaism in the vanishing old style of Japanese cinema. Without demolishing the concepts of conservative film, Nikkatsu was able to preserve the pure Japanese plastic beauty in Tanaka constructed the Kyoya in its entirety in the Mukojima studio. The partition walls could be removed according to the camera position, and for natural representation of actors move-garden\_ shop

After this, Nikkatsu was to make a series ofhigh quality films, before the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1923 Tanaka made Dokuro no mai ('Dance of the skull' , 1923), using actors and actresses who belonged to the Association of Stage Players. It was portrayal of the asceticism of a Buddhist and, at eleven reels, was works , in particular Stroheim's Foolish Wives   (1922). Japanese films were finally being received on the same level as foreign, especially American, films priest

Together with Tanaka, Kensaku Suzuki was the first

auteur in the history of Japanese cinema. In addition to these two, younger directors emerged in this period, like Osamu Wakayama and, youngest of all, Kenji Mizoguchi, Tanaka's protégé and assistant on Kyoya Erimise. Some of the most important achievements in Japanese film are found in the works of Suzuki. In a short of activity, he realized a film form akin to the European avant-garde, and anticipated wholly new trend of film-making that would arise suddenly in the aftermath of the Earthquake. The extremely pessimistic style and content of his films were feverishly applauded by the young audience of the time Tabi no onna ('The itinerant female artiste' , 1923) portrays the parallel lives of two desperate souls, man and a woman who only meet by chance in the final scene to part and go on their gloomy ways. In the man is tragically besotted with bleakest realism came in Ningen-ku (Anguish of a human 1923) in which Suzuki rejected conventional narrativity, and demonstrated his ideology of pessimism in a new form. The first reel of this four-reel film shows the fragmented existences of various assorted low-life characters: a starved old man, a group of tramps, bad and prostitutes The lives of these poor and ill-fated people is paralleled by the glittering images of an aristocratic ball.

The archaic form of Japanese art and culture still exerted influence on Japanese cinema beyond the early period. For from

## THE SILENT CINEMA EXPERIENCE

## Music and the Silent Film

Silent films were a technological accident, not an aesthetic choice. If Edison and other pioneers had had the means, music would probably have been an integral part of filmmaking from the very start. But because such means were lacking, a new type of theatrical music rapidly developed; the Europe or America between 1895 and the late 1920s came tobe matched by an equally wide rangeofmusical practice musical materials. With the coming of synchronized sound this variety disappeared and a whole past experimusicians and historians have begun to rediscover the field and even to find new forms of accompaniment for and

Relatively little of this music is known today; but what has  been seen (like the collection of Victorian-period examples published by Mayer and Scott) bears strong family likeness to the seemingly 'new dental music supplied just as did those who specialized in the genres of ballet and pantomime. The latter genres sometimes came very close to anticipating the peculiar requirements of scores for silent films, owing and open-ended and fragmentary; intended to mirror the smallest details of stage action. pub

## MUSICAL PRACTICE

Music in silent cinema has been of interest to film theorists, and number of explanations have been proposed to account for its apparently indispensable presence right from the start. These have tended to concentrate on the psycho-acoustic functions of music (well summarized by Gorbman 1987) and only recently have historians begun to pay close attention to the theatrical context of film presentations and in particular to the debt owed by long

Consider, for example, the remarkable variety richness ofso-called 'incidental' music for stage plays throughout the nineteenth century (a variety that becomes still richer if one looks further to the past) At one end, lavish incidental works by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Bizet, and though somewhat atypical; proved highly useful for film accompaniment-or we can presume since excerpts from these works were repeatedly published in film music anthologies and inserted into compiled scores (often for scenes quite unlike their original contexts) . But most theatre music was the work of minor figures, who like their successors in the field of film music, continually had tocompose, arrange, conduct, or improvise functional bits and 'mélodrames' 'hurries' , 'agits', and duction after another. and pieces -

Paradoxically;   the theatrical genre with perhaps the most on film music was the with which its affinity was the weakest, namely opera Instrumental   arrangements from many hundreds of popular works (Italian, French\_ German, English) were called for in silent-film cue sheets of the 1910s and 1920s; that time Wagner's  development of symphonic   approach  (the orchestra   supplying continuous commentary), characterized by the use of symbolic themes, long-range thematic transformations , much admired that many leading composers of film scores pertz, and Mortimer Wilson, all discussed below) either explicitly acknowledged his influence or implicitly imitated his style, albeit with   less than Wagnerian results.

This phase marks the beginning of film music as a distinct profession, but for a time many theatre owners neglected the musical end of their operations: some of these pianos were out of tune, some of the performers quite unskilled. Still, the trade periodicals regularly mentioned certain theatres featuring music to praise rather than blame; and the importance of music even in these modest arenas is further attested by the widespread custom of enhancing programmes with 'illustrated songs' (as in small-time vaudeville houses).

## MUSICAL MATERIALS

The first and most succinct aids for performers were what types of music to accompany particular films, with cues and supplementary instructions. At first these lists were relatively crude and perhaps not all that reliable but like other aids became steadily more apt, sophisticated, and commercially valuable during the second half of the silent period, reflecting changes in cinema itself. It is interesting to compare the anonymous cue sheet for the Edison Company's one-reel Frankenstein (1910) and the 'Thematic Music Cue Sheet' prepared by James C. Bradford for Paul Leni's popular feature The Cat and the Canary (1927). The former is typical specimen they

from the pioneering series 1912 in the American edition of the Edison Kinetogram and offers merely the barest outline of an accompaniment, comprising fourteen cues beginning as follows:

At opening: Andante ~'Then You'll Remember Me'

- Till monster is forming: Increasing agitato
- Till Frankenstein's laboratory: Moderato'Melody in F'
- Till monster appears over bed: Dramatic music from Der Freischütz
- Till father and girl in sitting room: Moderato
- Till Frankenstein returns home: 'Annie Laurie'
- letc]

In contrast, the Canary cue sheet was issued as lavish eight-page brochure in a coloured cover (apparently an exceptional format), and out sixty-six explicit using three dozen pieces by more than two dozen composers. It also contains, on the front and back covers , detailed description of the score's recurring  themes, together with useful 'suggestions for playing' cue by cuesharp spells

By the 1920s, the latter materials had become just as elaborate as cue sheets (which, as in the Bradford example drew from them extensively for repertoire) after similarly modest beginnings. Early anthologies were made up of not-too difficult piano pieces usually running to no more than single page, as in Zamecnik's collections of Sam Fox Moving Picture Music (seventy original pieces in three volumes, 1913-14; a fourth volume appeared in 1923) and the Witmark Moving Picture Album (an in-house compilation

The differences are significant, but there is one monuments of nineteenth-century repertoire for crucial scenes. In Frankenstein, 'dramatic music' from Weber's Freischütz is called for five times (vague cues indeed, probably indicating eerie to be performed ad lib) whenever the monster appears; in Canary, the beginning of Schubert's Unfinished'  Symphony appears four times and is identified as the 'Mammy Theme' . (The music, according to Bradford, indicates 'the uncertainty and questionable position of this woman who is distrusted' .) Both scores also mix their classical ments with morsels in varied lighter styles: Frankenstein includes a sentimental salon piece and an old-fashioned parlour song (Rubinstein's Melody in F''Annie Laurie'); Canary brings together many comic misteriosos and up-todate popular numbers, allsuitable for the film's tongue-incheek tone. Such jumbles were the norm (though Bradford claims that his suggested music offers 'a perfect sequence because were seen as the most appropriate way to follow the films; and one finds the same sort of odd but functionally efficient hodge-podge within the period's anthologies and catalogues key point frag; they

a recurrent emphasis on music for 'national scenes and ethnic groups (especially patriotic songs and exotic pieces of 'Indian' OI 'Oriental music) with basic moods were intended to be more comprehensive and systematic For example, all but two of the fourteen volumes of the Hawkes PhotoPlay Series (1922-7) contained half a dozen expansive pieces, each by different English composer; and, as was then typical, each volume could be obtained in a piano album andJor in arrangements for small or full orchestra\_ along

The most impressive book of   piano music however; was Erno Rapée's Motion Picture  Moods (1924), which contained 370 pieces, many of them of great difficulty; indexed under fifty-three headings. In unique format these headings are listed alphabetically on the margin of every page to facilitate 'rapid reference' , but the contents of the book are really too vast for such an index todo more than steer pianists in the right direction The group of National pieces alone extends over 150 pages, beginning with the USA (for which there is the lengthiest subsection, including patriotic hymns, college songs, and Christmas carols) and then proceeding alphabetically from Argentina to Wales, with a assortment of anthems, dances, and traditionalsongs. Rapée followed this the next year with an Encyclopedia of Music for Pictures aimed at directors of ensembles: the book offered more headings, plus great deal of   space for additional numbers to be added to the lists, allowing for each theatre some of these libraries-for example the Balaban & Katz collection in Chicago and the Paramount in Oaklandhave turned up virtually intact, and while each is organized differently; all tend to follow a system similar to Rapée's.) As compendium of repertoire the Encyclopedia was superseded only by the thematic index in Hans Erdmann and Giuseppe Becce's two-volume Allgemeines Handbuch der Film-Musik (1927), one of the period's last and most valuable sources . huge library

By the mid-1920s, then, the spectrum of film music publications encompassed tens of thousands of pieces , some of them arrangements ofpre-existent material; some newly composed for film accompaniment; and some nominally new but clearly based on existing themes\_ New or old, the music was then indexed according to the purpose it could serve in film accompaniment. It would seem that almost any piece was suitable for more than one context, at least could be rendered of performance, no matter how it was marked. Rapée's anthology contains an item called 'Agitato No. 3' , by Otto Langey, whose first strain is obviously modelled on Schu-

But Rapée indexes it under 'Battle' and elsewhere in the anthology, even more confusingly; the actual beginningofSchubert's own song is categorized as a 'misterioso' (despite its tempo marking of 'presto'). The more the repertory grew, therefore, the more it seems to have fundamentally stayed the same, dictated by functional requirements. Most pieces were expected to communicate their essential messages within the space of a few bars , and often had to be broken off for the next cue. (In Bradford's list, the shortest items Under the circumstances , too much stylistic variety was made the music sometimes went with it) might be valued highly fOr its allusive power, even if the reference was imprecise. they

Similar considerations apply when evaluatingcompiled scoreS . As mixed in their repertoire as cue sheets, many were stereotyped and seemingly haphazard; and all were liable to be altered greatly to perthe synchronization of the music were carefully planned, and led to results well above the norm Three examples can serve to illustrate the range of possibilities, as determined by types and circumstances of their productionfdistribution.

1. Walter C. Simon's music for the 1912 Kalem film The Confederate   Ironclad: this concise piano score, from an impressive series Simon created for Kalem in 1912 and 1913, was written for an advanced example of film narrative at that time. It fits the film exceptionally well, and even though much of it is 'original' , it is very much like written out cue-sheet score, with several pre-existent tunes

2. Breil's orchestral score for The Birth of a Nation can be seen as Simon score writ with the added interest of extensive original music involving more than a dozen By this time too, the repertoire has been opened up to include a large number of nineteenth-century symphonic and operatic works, more suitable for orchestral than piano accompaniments, and necessary for such a film There is no doubt that Griffith wanted music to be an integral part of the film experience and, although the degree of his involvement cannot be known precisely, he certainly played a role in encouraging Breil's ambitious efforts large, epic.

3. The Axt-Mendoza score for Vidor's Parade follows the Breil model and is no less major piece of work, though with neither the same amount of original music nor the personal stamp of the Griffith scores. Indeed, just as this later epic displays a smoother style than Griffith's , Big

becomea polished 'studio' product. In this case, the studio was inside a New York theatre, where Riesenfeld created the score and gave itits première; the city like Berlin, had become prime locale for the manufacture of scores, thanks to co-operative partnerships between film pro ducers, theatres. and music publishers

Alongside compiled scores , original scores also increased in number in the 1920s, often with remarkable results. A significant American example is Mortimer Wilson's music for Raoul Walsh's 1924 The Thief of Bagdad: richly worked out in terms ofboth thematicstructure and orchestration, its lavish designis fitting forsoopulent a film and presages the achievements of Erich Korngold and the great composers of Hollywood scores in the sound period. But the most impressive centres of original work were not in New York or Hollywood, but in France, Germany, and Russia, where the fascination of artists and intellectuals with the new medium led to unique collaborations

Of the many innovative scores by composers who gravitated toward film in the 1920s, three in particular deserve mention, each successful in attaining different goals.

An important precedent had been set in Europe much earlier, with Camille Saint-Saëns' s score for the 1908 film experience and mastery of his craft, this score displays impressive thematic unity and harmonic design, and is as polished as his many previous essays in ballet, pantomime, and tone Yet because it serves the film so well the score has come to share the fate ofhis other incidental pieces: mentioned in surveys but rarely studied, regarded more as a fascinating transitional effort than as a convincing work of art. poem.

- 1. Eric Satie's score for Entr'acte (1924) shines as an antiit is designed both to dazzle and to disorient the audience\_ partly by parodying the medium's customary product, partly by following a subtle formal logic beneath decep tively random surface.
- 2 The Huppertz score for Metropolis (1927), commost peculiar examples known to survive of music following Wagner's leitmotiv system, within an elaborate symphonic framework. Apparently following Lang' original tripartite structure for the film, Huppertz divides his score into three independent movements with the unusual Zwischenspiel' , and Furioso'\_ Like century melodrama and twentieth-century modernism, and that is an essential part of its fascination: it strives

to reinforce Lang's messages, and, while showing similarities to the American compilations discussed above, employs a far more complex and varied musical vocabulary.

3. Dmitri Shostakovich's score for Kozintsev and Trauberg's New Babylon   (1929) ranks among the greatest examples of film music by a leading avant-garde composer of any generation Like the film, and somewhat like Satie's score for Entr'acte, the music is in large part satirical, and depends for its effects on the distortion of well-known tunes , especially the Marseillaise' as well as the use of French-style 'wrong-note' harmonies and persistent motor rhythms-all designed to offer both counterpoint and conscore (now available in a complete recording by the Berlin Radio Symphony) also makes   strong ideological and attains tragic stature\_ One great example occurs at the end of part vi, for scenes of the despair, desperate resistance, and massacre of the Communards. While an revolutionary pauses to play piano abandoned on the barricades, and while his comrades listen, visibly moved the orchestra pauses too, for the pit pianist's poignant fragment of 'source music' (Tchaikovsky's 'Chanson triste'); this trails off, and when the final battle begins, the orchestra commences resolves into a thumpingly banal waltz. Thus Shostakovich emphasizes the brutality of the French bourgeoisie; who are seen applauding at Versailles, as if presiding over the scenes of carnage. No less pointed is the music for the film's end; though it aims in an opposite direction: here Shostakovich combines a noble theme for the munards with the melody of the Internationale in rough, dissonant counterpoint. The double purpose is to honour the martyrdom of the film's heroes, and, more generally, to convey hope without clichéd sentiment. In a final symfitting match to the film's openended final three shots of thewords Vive" 'la' | 'Commune" seen scrawledasjagged graffiti pointing dynamically past the edges of the frame points old horn Com-

Each of these three scores offers a unique solution to the challenging compositional problems posed by an unusual film. Together, expressive potential to the highest degree. they

## SILENT FILMS AND MUSIC TODAY

Even as Shostakovich completed his score, silent films were rapidly becoming obsolete. It did not take for many of the practices and materials of the period to be to revive them. Cinematheques and other venues where silent films continued to be screened went on providing piano accompaniments, but often in mode that was neither musically inspiring nor historically accurate At long

the Museum of Modern Art in New York between 1939 and 1967, however; Arthur Kleiner maintained the tradition of using original accompaniments, availing himself of the Museum's collection of rare scores; where scores were which were reproduced in multiple copies and rented out with the films-

In recent years scholarly work (particularly in the USA and Germany) has greatly increased OUI knowledge of silent music; archives and festivals  (notably denone in Italy and Avignon in France) have provided new venues for the showing of silent films with proper attention to the music; and conductors such Anderson and Carl Davis have created or re-created orchestral scores for major silent classics. This initially specialist activity has spilled over into the commercial arena. In Napoléon vied for public attention in number of major Brownlow and David Gill, with score composed and conducted by Carl Davis, and the other with a score compiled and conducted by Carmine Coppola. Even wider the issue of videocassettes and laser discs of a wide range of silent films, from Keystone to Metropolis, all with musical accompaniment. Cops

As for the scores themselves, they too can be divided into three basic types: (1)a score that dates from the silent era, whether compiled or original (Anderson has made this type of score her speciality); (2) a score newly created

Both because of and despite these advances, however, with no consensus as to what the music should be like or how it should be presented. (There was a lack ofconsensus during the silent period, too, but the spectrum was not as a film in silence, an approach now generally held to be undesirable except in the very rare cases of films designed to be shown that way, we can distinguish three basic modes of presentation currently in use: (1) film screened synchronized musical sound-track and screened in an auditorium; (3) video Or disc versions screened on television at home. Obviously, the second and third modes, while more prevalent and feasible than the first, take us increasingly further from the practices of the period. To show copy with a synchronized score on a sound-track is to alter fundamentally the nature of the theatrical experience; indeed, once recorded, the music hardly seems 'theatrical at all. As for home viewing, whatever its advantages it forgoes theatricality to the point that any type of continuous music. and especially thunderous orchestras and organs, can weigh heavily on the viewer. laser

Thus, altogether there now exist nine possible combinations of music and silent cinema (three modes of presentation, three types of score) and all of them have yielded results both subtle and obtrusive, both satisfying and offensive

Particularly interesting in this respect are the cases where different versions have recently been prepared of the same film. For Intolerance, for example, there now exist on the Breil score and has been performed in conjunction with a restoration of the film (by MOMA and the Library of Congress) in a version as close as possible to that seen at the 1916 New York première. There is a Brownlow-Gill restoration with Davis score, which has been screened both live and on television There is the 'modernist' Duhamel and Jansen version And a laser disc also exists of a further restoration with recorded organ score by Carter. In the case of Metropolis popular attention has been grabbed by the Moroder version with its synthetic mix of disco styles and new songs performed by various pop artists, but the film has been presented several times with version of the original Huppertz score adapted and conducted and with semi-improvisatory scores performed live by avant-garde ensembles. It is not possible to make hard-and-fast choices between the differpersuasively in favour of the presentation of a film like originally designed for it, but even she has admitted that

By the middle of the 1920s the cinema had reached a peak of splendour which in certain respects it would never surpass. It is true that there was not synchronized sound nor Technicolor; except at a very experimental stage. Synchronized sound was to be introduced end of the decade, while Technicolor came into use only in the mid 1930s and beyond. Nor; except in isolated cases like  Abel Gance's Napoléon (1927), was there anything approaching the wide screen that audiences were to be accustomed to from the 1950s onwards. It is also the case that viewing conditions in many parts of the world, paragain

such meticulous restorations can have more historical than aesthetic interest. Meanwhile a case can also be made for the enlivening use of anachronistic' particularly for unconventional films; though the case of Metropolis shows that the use of trendy pop-music scores can make the film itself look dated when the music itself begins to date and progressive styles of jazz and minimalism can provide a more effective counterpoint to the film

The simple fact is that music for to be truly authentic probably futile to expect that the musical traditions of silent cinema will ever be fully restored; for one we simply cannot watch the films in the same way as Our ancestors, after so many decades ofexperience with sound films, and after so much of the original repertoire has either been forgotten or has lost any semblance of freshness. The best that can be hoped for, perhaps, is that from time to time we will be able to return to the theatre to hear whether old Or new, that makes an effective match to the film and is sensitively performed; when this happens, we are better able to imagine thesilent cinema's past glories, and toexperience it as an art still vital century after it all they : began.

But there were many compensations. Audiences in cities throughout the developed world were treated to a spectacle which only twenty years earlier would have been unimaginable. In the absence of on-screen sound there were orchestras and sound effects.

distortion, large enough to give physical embodiment to the grand scale of the action.

The scale of the action projected into the large spaces which film-makers   designed films to be seen in was perhaps the most striking feature of the silent cinema in its heyday. There was grandeur and larger-than-life quality both in the panoramic shots incorporating landscapes, battles, or and in the close-ups magnifying details of an object or a face. It was rare for a film to miss out on opportunities to aggrandize its subject; whether this was the conquest of the West or life on collective farm. The houses of the rich tended to be mansions and those of the poor teeming tenements. Heroes and heroines were beautiful, villains ugly; and dramatic values were projected on to the bodies of the performers , enhanced by effects of shot scale and camera angle. long orgies,

Many of these qualities were to be lost with the coming ofsound. Live music disappeared from all but a handful of auditoriums Tinting and toning effects were abandoned because the colour on the film interfered with the sensors for  reading the sound-track. The focus moved from visualeffects to the problems ofsound recordand on the exhibition side\_ to the installation of playback equipment.

## INDUSTRY

The key to the spectacular development of the silent cinema (and to its rapid transition to sound at the end of the 1920s) lay in its industrial organization. This was not an incidental characteristic-as maintained for example by writer, film-maker; and (twice) French Minister of Culture André Malraux, who once described the cinema as being 'par ailleurs' ('furthermore an Rather; the potential for industrial developmentwas built intrinsic dependence on technology (camera, film stock, projector) and through its emergence in the early period The early cinema should not really be dignified with the was a small scale, using equipment and technology which (with the exception of the film stock itself) could be put together in an artisanal workshop. But as films became more elaborate; and the level of investment necessary to make them and ensure their distribution increased , the cinema came to acquire a genuinely industrial character-in the scale of dependence on capital. airily its

The of cinema was not the coming of sound at the end of the 1920s, which consummated its integration into the world of finance capital and its links (via the electric companies) to music recording and radio. But already in the years after the end of the First World War the cinema had acquired its character as prototype of what has since them it was not just a technology used to transmit a preexisting content. The content itself was created by means of the technology. Having been technologically created , films then also had to be distributed to places where related technology could be used for showing them The quantity of investment, the time scale over which it was deployed, and the need to match supply and demand imposed on the cinema not only industrial organization at the point of production, but related business practice at every level Films were produced the market, and operations designed to manage market demands had greatinfluence on film production This was to have unprefor

Films were produced in studios. Although the American film companies had moved to southern California in the 1910s partly for the sake of the abundant sunlight and the variety of locations, by the 1920s a majority of scenes had come to be shot in artificial settings, either indoors under electric light or outdoors on constructed sets. Film-makers ventured on to locations only for scenes (or single shots) which could not be simulated in the studio. Studio shootfilming conditions; it was also more economical. The twin needs of economy and control also gave rise to simplified methods of constructing sets and ever more sophisticated ways of putting shots and scenes together with the aid of special effects of one kind or another. ing

Although in common parlance the term special effects is generally reserved for techniques which simulate fantastic events, many of the same techniques were in practice more often used for the portrayal of realistic scenes \_ as an easier and cheaper way of shooting them than ifthe scene had to be reproduced in actual real settings. The enormous expense of constructing the actual-size sets for the Babylonian sequence of Griffith's Intolerance (1916) spurred companies to research simpler ways of place in actual a scene studio shots (for example close-ups) would be matched to location shots, while a single shot could be composed of heterogeneous elements carefully merged to look as if it represented single reality. A simple device was to paint part of a scene on glass plate, with the action being shot through the clear portion of the glass. But there were also more complicated techniques;suchastheonedevised bythe German cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan in the mid-1920s and used, among other films, on Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927). This involved constructing miniature sets which were scraped mirror was then placed in front of the camera, at an angle of forty-five degrees. The action was shot through the scraped part ofthe mirror; whilethesets were reflected through the unscraped part. Alternatively part ofthescene could be obscured by a matte, and inserted into the shot later in the laboratory  Or a background (shot on location by a second film unit) could be projected on a screen at the back ofthe studio,whilethe characters performed in front ofit, though this did not come into widespread use until needed to be taking

The effect of these developments in studio production techniques was to push the cinema of thelate silent period more and more in the direction of realistic illusion, blurthe boundaries between the obviously illusionistic and the unquestionably real. Fiction films aspired to ring

effect whether their content was realistic events or fantastic and implausible ones. Only at the margins were films made which either played on effects for their own sake (or for the audience to wonder at) or which depended on unmediated authenticity in portraying real events Occasionally; as in comedy; these two extremes would be joined and the audience would be left marvelling both at the fantastic that were happening (or appeared to be happening) and at the real physical achievement ofthe gag taking place in real time in a real place. More often however, the resources at the disposal of the studio were deployed for purposes of generic verisimilitude; the action had a sufficient of truth' for the means of its enactment to pass largely unnoticed. reality things 'ring

The idea that cinema could use artifice of many kinds to create a selfsufficient cinematic reality emerged slowly, and continued to be felt as something of a paradox. The first person really to get to grips with this paradox was probably the Soviet film-maker and theoretician Lev Kuleshov; whose famous 'experiments' in the early 1920s were devoted to shots was determined by their juxtaposition rather than by their intrinsic 'real-life properties\_ But Kuleshov's experiments  focused almost entirely on montage (the together of shots) rather than on the potential for artifice present in the making ofthe shot itself, and it was in Germany and in Hollywood, where the techniques of studio production were most highly   developed, that realist illusionism (more realist in the Hollywood case, more illusionist in the German) really came into its own as the dominant aesthetic of the silent film. iting

## MELODRAMA, COMEDY, MODERNISM

During the silent period most of the genres emerged that were to characterize the cinema throughout the studio period-crime films, Westerns, fantasies, etc. Ofthe classic genres only the musical, for obvious reasons, was absent though many films were made for   non-synchronized musical accompaniment.  Overarching the generic categories into which films were grouped for marketing purposes, however; the films of the silent period (and to can be categorized under two main 'modes' the comic and the melodramatic\_

The term melodrama is used by film scholars to designate two types of film in particular-those (particularly in the very early period) which show a clear historical descent from nineteenth-century theatrical melodrama, and the sagas of love and family life (often overlapping with so called women's pictures that had such powerful presence in Hollywood in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. These uses are not strictly compatible; since the two types melodrama was highly gestural and involved the accent-

uating ofmoral and dramatic values around characteristic motifs-heroes spurred to action by revelations of unspeakable villainy, leading to last-minute rescues of These features are all somewhat attenuated in the called melodramas of the later period, and are instead to be found more often in action films (such as Westerns) than in the increasingly psychologicaldramas ofthe 1930s and after. Links between the two are to be found in the work of D W. Griffith, who formalized the means for inserting melodramatic values into the flow of cinematic narrative and (by his use ofthe close-up as both a narrative and an emotive device) gave the conventional melodrama measure of psychological depth; and in that of Frank Borzage, who, in Humoresque (1920), 7th Heaven (1927), and turned of melodrama into characters driven by preternatural inner strength.

tinuation in the cinema With the steady increase in the length of films about 1913 onwards-from three or four reels to six or even more in the post-war period-filmmakers were able to turn to stories of broader scope and greater complexity, often in the form of adaptations of novels Despite the refinement of narrative technique, however, it was rare for this opportunity to be translated in the direction of realistic and nuanced character development. Rather (and this is as true if not truer of the bulk of European production as it was of American) narratives became clotted with incident, while thecharacters to whom the incidents happened continued to be drawn in schematic terms . In Rex Ingram's acclaimed Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921). for example; the main characters and the values represent are proclaimed in the intertitles early in the film and typified in appearance and gesture throughout the action, which is spread over several decades. Although the moral values of Griffith's melodramas, and their embodiment in scowling villains , luckless heroes , and perennially threatened from they

It has often been explained in terms ofmimetic gifts honed in Chaney's childhood attempt to communihistrionic style of acting that was quickly passing away from the screen in the 1920s.The talents ofthe 'Man ofa Thousand Faces' were not used to address a wide rangeof roles as the suggests, but a surprisingly narrow range that exploited his face and body as a spectacle of grotesque possibilities. spite epithet

Some of the literary and theatrical realism appear in the films of Erich dinavian directors such as G W Pabst, Carl Theodor Dreyer; and Victor Sjöström\_ but on the whole broadly melodramatic approach to both character and plot prevailed on both sides of the Atlantic-whether in action films or in those purporting to be more psychological in intent.

Relief from the melodramatic mode in the silent period On the one hand there was what is generally thought of as silent film comedy; uniquely brilliant genre centred on comic performance (often of a knockabout type) and typified by the names of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton Harold Lloyd, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. This type of comedy exploited to the full the mimic and action potential of the silent cinema and although it more Or less died with the arrival of the talkies it continues to be appreciated and enjoyed. But the silent cinema also possessed different type of comedy; whose destiny has been exactly the opposite. This was the attempt to realize in the silent medium a form of comedy; based on the stage play; which in its original form was heavily dependent on verbal wit and repartee. Comedy of this type was severely hampered by the absence of spoken dialogue but it came into its own Silent examples of the genre have consequently tended to engaged the talents of some of the greatest artists of the period, including Mauritz Stiller, Ernst Lubitsch; and even Chaplin. It was Chaplin's A Woman of Paris in 1923 which launched the career of Adolphe Menjou as the archetypal with Lubitsch's The Marriage Circle later that while in 1925 Lubitsch himself exceeded the bounds of what would be thought possible in silent film with Fan in which every wicked nuance is conveyed by subtle touches of look and gesture. again ning year;

Much of the appeal of the society comedy for popular audiences in the opportunity to enjoy and at the same time ironize over the lives of the idle rich. But even more it gave the opportunity to ironize over the values of the melodrama. Many of the situations and devices of the society comedy (and indeed of comedy of other types) are identical with those of the melodrama-confusion of identities, the character forced into an unwelcome marriage, the letter that goes astray It is the manner in which are treated, and the emotional response provoked in the audience, that is antithetical. lay they

Comedy brought to the cinema an element of modernity; which the melodrama generally lacked. This is true both of the comedy of manners, with its ironic view of the moral dilemmas of modern life, and of the knock about kind, which regularly foregrounded motor cars, machinery, and similar emblems of modernity. Comedy was also route through which artistic modernism entered the silent cinema, both through the conscious efforts of the avantgarde (as in René Clair' s Entr'acte ('Interlude') and Eisenstein's Glumovs Diary) and in less obvious ways . Though there were attempts to melo drama in modernistic vein, Anton gaglia's Thais  (1917) to Marcel Herbier's Inhumaine (1924), they rapidly degenerated into a rather sterile deco rativism and soon dissolved back into more conventional approaches. exploit from

Soviet modernism was facilitated by the fact that in the early   years the State was   prepared (not always enthusiastically) to risk substantial resources on experiments which had no guarantee of immediate popular success. In the rest of Europe and in Japan, by contrast (and even more in the United States) , the introduction of potentially unpopular modernist elements into feature film-making was restricted by commercial considerations. The radical modernism which flourished in avant-garde circles in France in particular was therefore expressed more on the fringes than in the mainstream of film pro painting and theatre to enter parts of the film world and was also influential in Japan. But it tended to be the more conservative aspects of Expressionism-those most easily German studios; the more radical side of Weimar culture was politically as well as aesthetically risky; and had little impact on the mainstream. What was very strong in as quasi-transcendent value In film terms, this sometimes meant the tacking on to film ofsignifers of artistic quality; but there (1924) is the most striking example; to create an artistic language of film based purely on the expressive qualities of the image from

The most   systematic attempt to develop cinema around the tenets of artistic modernism, however; came in the Soviet Union, where in the early years of the Revolution artists   enjoyed relative freedom from commercial (and even political) constraint and experimented art of the machine, involving new concept of vision (Vertov's 'camera-eye') and of the mechanization of the human body. Editing (the famous 'Soviet montage' ) , acting (the 'Factory of the Eccentric Actor'), and narrative (centred on the mass as opposed to the individual hero) were the object of concerted experiment to a degree unparalleled elsewhere.

While the broad lines of film narrative in the silent were dictated by the demands of dramaturgy and plot, which tended to remain crude, the detail of scene construction underwent development, particularly in the American cinema The transitional period saw the emergence of specifically cinematic means of changes of scene and crea narrative continuity within in the middle and late 1910s were formalized and refined inthe 1920s to create a system which hascome tobe known variously as 'invisible' 'continuity' and 'analytic' edie niques of editing and scene construction which provided the hallmark of what, since the ground-breaking work of Bordwell, Thompson, and Staiger (1985) has come to be known as the classical Hollywood style. period rapid cueing

The terms invisible and continuity editing refer to the fact that, at least within the scene, action was supposed to appear continuous and the joins between shots invisible. In practice, however, editing within the scene was never perfectly invisible, and dramatic effects were often achieved by cuts which were not only visible but actively presented to the spectator as narrative devices-for example in order to show that character was observed by another; previously unseen character and that more was going on than initially met the eye. An alternation of continuity and discontinuity was also importto alert the spectator to the significance of scene changes without recourse to intertitles\_ being

In order for scenes to function, had to be broken down into components which were pre-planned in the light of a notion of what the action was supposed to be and how it should be pre-sented\_ Although pictorial entered into consideration in the planning of scenes, primacy went to the way the action was articulated and how an idea of the action could be most effectively and economically to function as the fleshing out of a narrative idea, rather they

Analytic editing alsoconsummated the move away from frontality in the presentation of scenes. The scene was no longer assembled in front of the camera, to be staged in a more Or less theatrical manner. Instead the camera could enter inside the scene, acting as a mobile narrator directthe spectator's view now this way now that. To ensure that the spectator was stably oriented within the spaces demarcated by the sequence of camera angles, '180 degree rule came into use in the Hollywood cinema. An imaginary line was drawn across the scenic space in front of the action and so long as the camera did not cross this ing

French critic André Bazin discerned two main lines: the montage school, typified by Eisenstein, in which the putting together of elements to create predetermined meaning was all important; and a less clearly identifiable tendency, connected among others with Murnau and Stroheim, in which the reality inherent in each shot was allowed to speak for itself. Bazin's insight into one of the fundamental questions film's relation to visible reality\_remains pertinent, but the way he framed the question is misleading. For it was not only Soviet montage but the rival Hollywood system of continuity editing that set out to predetermine meaning and was, in its way; profoundly artificial, and used its artificeto direct the spectator's attention along preset lines\_

## ACTING AND THE STAR SYSTEM

gestural , since it was mainly by action and gesture that meaning had to be conveyed. With the development of analytic editing and increasing use of medium and close shots in the transitional period, acting in the American cinema became whole much more naturalistic than in the early period, and the same was generally true elsewhere. A strongly gestural style survived in Italy in particular throughout the 1910s, reaching histrionic extreme in performances by 'divas' such as Lyda Borelli opposite them. It was also a major component of German Expressionism\_ and given form by dramatic gesture More gence between techniques based on internalization of the role and those based on various forms of screen presence actor.

The idea of an actor's performance emerging from minute internalization of the role is generally associated with the work of Constantin Stanislavsky at the Moscow Arts Theatre in the 1910s and 1920s. Stanislavsky's ideas greatly influenced the early Russian cinema and were imported into America by the Russian émigrés, finding their way into cinema via the famous Actors' Studio founded by Elia Kazan and directed by Lee Strasberg in enjoyed mixed fortunes and were decisively rejected by many of the revolutionary Soviet film-makers in the 1920s. they

In the theatre the 'Stanislavsky system was contested

by Brecht and Piscator in Germany as well as by film and theatre groups such as FEX in the Soviet Union. Neither Brecht nor Piscator was able to put his ideas into practice in the silent cinema, and (isolated experiments apart) in the 1960s and 1970s. In the Soviet Union, however, the montage cinema called for, and received, approaches to actorial performance diametrically opposed to the internalization inherent in the Stanislavsky method .

varied between the demand for high degree of professionalism (but based on mechanized circus routines rather than psychology) the rejection of the values of professional acting. Pudovkin's 'typage' called actors to be chosen on the basis of physical features appropriate to what the character was meant to represent; screen could be put to use. Actors did not prepare for scenes, but were prepared (by the director) for each shot. acting and for

The American cinema also type-cast, but in a different way. Both melodrama and comedy required types, partially at least defined on the basis of appearance. In these conditions, an actor's ability to be an emblem of a particular role was often as valuable as the ability to create one. (This is not to say that roles and even types were not the comics and also of some melodramatic actors were all the object of conscious creation:) Generic recognition was also very important, and films were prO moted not only according to their type but according to the characters contained, and who performed them. It was not enough for an actor to a role in a particular film or group of films, and increasingly the status of the actor came to exceed that of the role that he or she played. Films became vehicles for the presence of their stars, and the stars screen images and what was known or believed about them in their off-screen existence not only drew people in to see the film but inflected their enjoyment and understanding of what was pOr-trayed\_ great they 'be'

The 'star system 1920s was an elaborate mechanism to enable the studios to exploit the physical attributes of the actors and actresses had under contract, and to organize the acting function and real-life existence of those who performed it around the creation and maintenance of an image As such it differed radically from the practices in use in other performing arts and in less industrially developed cinemas. It was not the   phenomenon of stardom that was new: Caruso could be considered star; or Sarah Bernhardt; Asta Nielsen has been called the first international film star. The system, however; was, and the industrial logic that lay behind it. they

The contract binding star to studio was on the face ofit an innocent document, obliging the to supply certain service exclusively to one purchaser in exchange for money and the promise of fame. Its basic similarity to contracts prevalent in other branches of business made it hard to challenge in the courts, as actors were to find out to their cost\_ What the actor was supplying however; was not really a service (nor was it labour, or a manufactured object); rather actors and actresses supplied themselves, into an image that became commodity for public consumption. So long as an actor's career went well, this was not experienced as oppressive. But when actors found themselves miscast, or not cast at all, Or put out on loan, metaphors of slavery and prostitution were invoked to describe their lot. Of these, the prostitution metaphor is the more apposite; since stars were often chosen (and marketed) on the basis of their sex appeal, and rented out their bodies to the studio to be turned into sexually desirable images.

an essential pre-condition of the cinema as a viable mass entertainment\_ But the evidence about the class and gender composition of the audience remains fragmentary in North America in the 1920s seem to been increasingly middle-class, as the industry systematically targeted the affluent white suburban population. But while this may have been Hollywood's strategy; in practice audiences were quite varied in composition In America itselfthere were separate black and other ethnic audiences, while in Britain the audience is almost always described as prevailingly workingclass. Real cultural and demographic differences between countries undoubtedly played a role in determining the composition of audiences, but differences of   perception affected how were described.

If modernity and industrialism in the Soviet cinema meant mechanizing the meant commodifying it. The star system was the ne plus ultra of the fetishism of commodities analysed by Marx in Capital.  Audiences, however, demanded more than just saw on the screen. wanted to know who the lovers kissing on the screen were, and what did in real life. This desire was fed, but also frustrated, by a constant flow of information (much of it fabricated) about the off-screen lives and loves of the stars .

Women were an important component of the film audience. The First World War brought women into the labour market, and the loss of a whole generation of men in the trenches meant that after the war many single women found themselves independent lives. Even in countries which had not experienced the carnage of war, female emancipation new possibilities of employment gave women a changed social position. The post-war generation of women was large part not only of the audience for films but of the readership of magazines which celebrated the cinema and its heroes and heroines culture where few women attained positions of power and obvious influence it was the desires of this generation which helped to form, and in turn were formed by, the social imaginary of the silent cinema in its heyday.

## Introduction

At the end of the 1920s the cinema underwent a revo lution. The centre of this revolution was the introduction of synchronized sound dialogue, but it affected other areas as well, leaving very few untouched. It was a revo lution that began in America and spread inexorably to the European inflection and some remote corners of the world did not feel the effects of any of it for some time\_

The revolution can be conveniently dated from 6 October 1927, with the New York première ofWarner Bros. The Jazz Singer in which Al Jolson pronounces the immortal synchronization between his lips in the film and his voice recorded in parallel on a disc. But that was only a beginWestern Electric was replaced by simpler and more reliable soundon-film system devised by the rival poration General Electric. A European consortium led by the German companies Siemens and AEG entered the and successfully seized market for sound equipment. Within a few years thousands of theatres in Europe and America were wired fOr sound using   technology licensed   from the powerful patents holders. Only in the Soviet Union and Japan was the conversion to sound slow to take effect. ning fray

Sound affected film form and the structure of the industry in equal measure. The old silent comedy was replaced by the wisecracking of Mae West and the Marx Brothers. An entirely new genre, the musical film, came into The integration of music on to the sound-track brought massive redundancies among theatre musicians but it also meant that exhibition conditions became standardized since the film was now the same wherever it was shown. Visual styles became cramped by the inflexible new technology. Hollywood suffered a temporary set-back in overseas markets because audiences demanded diasound all dialogue had to be recorded live, the practice grew up of making films in multilingual versions, with different actors, until the institution of dubbing in the being.

The main effect of the coming of sound was consolidation of the studio system, both at the level of prO duction and at that of the overall organization of the

industry. Films became an increasingly industrial product; while the boundaries of the industry extended to overlap with the burgeoning music recording business.

The end of the war in 1945 meant a new beginning for the cinema in In east central Europe and in China the cinema revived rapidly after the devastation of war, but it was also subject to bureaucratic control by the newly installed Communist regimes. In Germany; Italy; and Japan the problem was one ofcreating a new cinema that would not be tainted by the legacy of complicity with Fascism. Indian independence; followed by a steady decolonization throughout Asia and Africa, aligned the cinemas of the emerging nations firmly with the struggle for national self-affirmation-

While the coming of sound can be seen as phenomenon internal to the cinema and music industries, it coincided with important events in the world outside.

After the war Hollywood acted quickly to the overseas markets it had lost But it the Italian neorealist movement, arising from the ashes of Fascism, demonstrated the possibility of a freer, less studiobound type of cinema More significant from an industrial of view; however, was the decline in audiences which set in after the war; first in Britain and the United States , and then in other industrialized nations\_ This coincided with the introduction in the United States themselves of the theatre chains which provided a nearcaptive audience for the studio's product. As well as the end of war, 1945 also marks the beginning of the end for the studio system, with Hollywood conducting rearguard action to retain its markets at home and abroad , and with the emergence of competing forms of cinema elsewhere in the world. regain point

world-wide importance of the coming of sound, as a factor the complex interlacing of aesthetic, industrial, and itical developments and the different temporalities in which were expressed in different parts of the world polthey -

After an initial look at the coming of sound itself, and its world-wide implications, the first focus is on the world of the studios; how the system operated-particularly in Hollywood\_and how different aspects ofthe cinema were meshed together during the studio period. The section The Studio Years deals first with industrial organization in the Hollywood studios in their heyday; with what sorts and how market influences made themselves felt. The studios, however; were not entirely free to make films simply for the market. The system also encountered problems of how to regulate itself to take account of political, social, and moral concern While other countries experienced political censorship of

fered relatively little interference from central government and was instead faced with carefully orchestrated demands for a moral clean-up and the risk ofintervention by local censor boards. To obviate the problem, which had severe economic implications, the industry engaged in rigorous programme of selfregulation, culminating in the setting up of the Production Code Administration in 1934

Along with spoken dialogue; the major innovation of the sound cinema was synchronized music. This rapidly developed into highly sophisticated musically and ance, and recording were all subject to studio control, and the production of musical tracks of high quality can be counted one of the greatest achievements of the system\_ Outside Hollywood music tracks were often less polished, but directors were more often free to work with composers stein's Alexander Nevsky (1938) provides an interesting contrast to two Warner Bros scoreS of the same period-Erich Korngold's The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and Max Steiner's Casablanca (1943).

Technologically, the main innovations of the studio years, apart from sound itself; were colour (beginning in new widescreen formats   (in the early 1950s). Although developed outside the studios, Techniexpensive and cumbersome. It was not until after the war that simplified colour systems (Agfacolor; Eastman Color) found their way on to the market, allowing colour to be used in cheaper films and even in documentary. Likewise, the arrival of widescreen needs to be seen in the context of the attempts by the studios to woo back audiences from television by restoring a sense of spectacle to the cinema experience. One sound, introduced into the mainstream cinema to provide stereo sound-tracks for widescreen films, proved to have much wider applications and helped to initiate revolution in documentary film-making at the end of the 1950s.

The first area of film-making to make extensive use of Technicolor was animation, in the person of Walt Disney. cottage industry into a form of mainstream studio production, as highly specialized as the making of live-action films. In synonymous with Warner Bros and MGM cartoons on the one hand and Disney's cartoons and animated features on the other. Marginalized during much of the studio period, independent animation nevertheless   survived and came into its own in the changed circumstances of the post-war years. again

next section, 'Genre Cinema examines the role of genre categories in the production and reception of films , and looks at some of the major genres that flourished during the studio period. While the majority of films can be seen to belong in some sort of genre category and division of films into genres is as old as the cinema itself (and indeed older, since early cinema inherited its categories other art forms), genre cinema in the strong in both production and marketing terms Genre cinema can flourish either as a specialist of an industry; as with 'Hammer horror' in Britain in the late 1950s and the very heart. In Hollywood in the studio period, it was at the heart of the system. Of the genres under consideration here, only the musical was specific to the years 1930-60. The Western dates back almost to the beginning of cinema, although, like the musical, it has been in neverquite-terminal decline since the 1960s; the chapter on the Western deals with the whole history of the genre, from The Great Train Robbery in 1903 to Unforgiven in 1992, in German and Italian Westerns en route. In the case of crime films, on the other hand, it has been necessary to The from fringe taking

In with Reality' we look at the impulses, many of them political, behind the impressive development of the documentary cinema in the early sound period, before opening up into the wider issues raised by political events in the the Russian Revolution, through Fascism and antiFascism, to the onset of the Cold War.

The strongest effects, of course, were felt in countries under totalitarian rule, but nowhere, not even Hollywood, was exempt from the political ebb and flow. 'Engag ing

While opposition to Hollywood power grew more vociferous, American movies were appreciated more than ever; not only for their entertainment value but their artistic qualities overall.

The final section of this part, War World' , looks first at the immediate aftermath ofwar and then at the tendencies at work in the late 1940s and 1950s which were to gather force as the period progressed and lead to the radically new developments that characterized the 1960s\_ larger for long

## The Introduction of Sound

## KAREL DIBBETS

The transition from silent to sound film marks period of grave instability as well as great creativity in the history technology produced panic and confusion, but it stimulated experiments and expectations too. While it undermined Hollywood's international position for several years, it led to a revival of national film production elsewhere  It is a period with specific features that differentiate it from the years before and after. This chapter will focus on these special characteristics; without track of some important continuities. Though the conversion to sound did not follow the same everywhere, and while every country has its own history; most attention will be paid here to the main line of develop ments losing path

To understand the impact of sound, it should not be forgotten that silent cinema was not silent at all. Silent films have plenty of references to all kinds of sounds; deliberately put the viewer in the position of a listener a cinema with live music performed by pianist or an orchestra, and often the musicians would add sound effects to the action on the screen. In Japanese cinemas a voice was added to the images by a lecturer or benshi, who actually dominated the film show with his verbal interpretations they

## DIFFUSION PROBLEMS

on both sides of the Atlantic had developed a range of technical devices to synchronize sound with moving images. The oldest method was to link a phonograph to a film projector. Thomas Edison himself built the prototype of this soundon-disc apparatus in the early it was still viable system in the 1920s. Another method, more inspired by modern electro-technics, did away with the discs and recorded sound directly on film. This sound-onfilm system would prevail and become the standard of the international film industry in the 1930s. days;

The conversion to sound did not depend completely on technology; nor would effects be restricted to technological matters. Software; not hardware; would become the deciding factor of the innovation process in the USA as well as in Europe, although this was not immediately its

in the 1926-7 began wiring their theatres for sound. Both studios hoped profit by investing in new technology; but the roads they followed were different.

The real breakthrough came during the 1927-8 season when Warners released with lipsync recordings of songs as well as some The Jazz Singer, directed by Alan Crosland and starring the popular vaudeville star Al Jolson, was really a silent few inserts with sound This hybrid   form, in which two technological eras come together; corresponds well to the melodramatic theme of the film. A conflict of generations finds expression in clash of two musical traditions that seem to be mutually exclusive: religious songs and profane jazz. In this way, the film gave birth to a new film genre, the musical.

Warners presented its first synchronized programme in August 1926 using soundon-disc system called Vitaphone. Warners main intention was to offer the cinema owners substitute for the live performers in their pro gramme, in particular the cinema orchestra and the stage show. Because of this, their first feature film with sound\_ Don Juan (1926), was not talking picture at all; it only used musical score recorded on discs to accompany the silent images. The studio was more interested in Vitaphone's shorts: lipsync-recorded performances of popular vaudeville and opera stars, who could now their act to even the smallest theatres. Fox did not believe in launched sound newsreels as its alternative, soundon-film system. Fox Movietone News, as it was called, became big attraction immediately. The success of these innovations was temporary, however, as the novelty appeal wore off. bring using

The success of The Jazz proved that sound could come off well if presented as full-fledged feature film with the other Hollywood studios rushed to convert to sound. was not unmotivated: the new technique would save the costs of live musical accompaniment in costs of conversion considerably (an advantage that did not apply to small cinemas). Cinema musicians were fired Singer

and   replaced by hardware By 1930 most American cinemas had been wired for sound and Hollywood had stopped making silent films. However, this was by no means the only effect of the conversion process

In 1928, after thorough examination of the different sound techniques; almost all studios decided to adopt Western Electric's sound-on-film system This meant the imminent end of Warners Vitaphone productions on studio, Radio-Keith-Orpheum This was estab who were unwilling to leave the motion picture industry to their major competitor; Western Electric. Once the studios had decided to convert, the innovation process entered a new phase. The rest of the world would feel the consequences as Hollywood, Western Electric, and RCA began to prepare fOr export. The 1928-9 season would become the year of the international diffusion of talking pictures May

The transition period in Europe, Japan, and Latin first public screening of American talking feature films. They

The arrival of American sound films provoked reaction from electronic companies in Europe, who immediately began to organize resistance. Patents were now seen as the hundreds of millions of dollars. This lucrative prospect appealed to the imagination of financial and industrial businessmen, and in 1928 two powerful companies were rapidly established. The first, Ton-Bild Syndikat AG, OI Tobis, owned the very important TriErgon patents as its main asset; it was created with Dutch and Swiss venture capital and The other company, Klangfilm GmbH, was backed by the industrial capacity of two major German electrical firms, AEG and Siemens . In March 1929 Tobis and Klangfilm agreed to form a cartel with the aim of fighting off the American invasion and bringing the entire European film industry under its control. They used patent suits to slow down their opponents, while advantage of language barkeys taking

The struggle for industrial control alone was enough to rock the foundations of the international film world, but this instability was increased by the language barrier silent picture could be exhibited in all countries of the world. A talking picture, however; became the prisoner of its own language. translation technique did not yet exist and it would take some years before dubbing was developed and generally adopted. Moreover; most pictures were English speaking, and this hurt the self-respect of nationalist feelings. Italy banned talking pictures that used languages other than Italian, and Spain, France Germany; Czechoslovakia, and Hungary took similar protectionist measures

As a result, the international film market, dominated by Hollywood for more than decade; suddenly began to disintegrate: it split into as many markets as there were languages. At first, these language barriers were bridged with songs; the did not rely on dialogue alone and could be enjoyed all over the world without translation. Since musicals were new and very popular; Hollywood was happy to make them in great quantities with lots of 'dialogue posed a real problem. Dialogue jeop ardized the concept of Hollywood as the centre of the international film industry. For some time, a decentral: ization of American film production appeared to be the only answer to the language problem, and in 1930 several American studios began to invest extensively in Europe's film industry. Paramount built a giant studio in Joinville; France, to produce multilingual films: would shoot the same set and costumes over Warners set out to co-produce a securing an important share in Europe's most promising venture in sound film production, Tobis. MGM approached the problem from the opposite end: it invited foreign actors to the USA to play the different language versions in its Hollywood studios. MGM could also employ some of its own stars to this end, as in Anna Christie (1930), in which Greta Garbo, born in Sweden, played a Swedish immigrant who speaks both English and German with accent films had been invented and tried out first in Great Britain in 1929 when E.

The latter could now collect all royalties on sound equipment and films in Europe. (Denmark proved to be an exception since Petersen and Poulsen successfully challenged the cartel with their own patents.) The rest of the world either became American territory or was open to both parties. Western Electric and RCA also agreed to the principle of interchangeability: equipment, and vice versa.

## REVOLUTION IN THE MOVIE THEATRE

The consequences of the coming of sound are usually evaluated with respect to the production of films, though the changes at the level of film exhibition and reception are of no less importance. Sound changed not only the

the viewer. In fact, the roots of silent film culture had to be demolished to give room to the rise of talking pictures. In the first place, the transferral of the orchestra from the pit to the sound-track marked the end of the cinema as a the cinema as a single-medium event. Musical accompaniment by a local orchestra was made superfluous; nor was it necessary any longer for the exhibitor to support his longer came to the theatre as semi-manufactured goods, but as final products. The new technology put an end to local variations in presentation. Sound films could offer a complete show in themselves, independent of local performers, and this show would be the same in every theatre all over the world. Thirdly; the definition of film changed drastically when music and sound effects, formerly live element of the viewing context, became an integral part ofthe recorded film text. As a result ofthis 'textualization of the context, the film text as an independent, autonomous artefact came into being. This would lead, among other to new concepts in film theory and criticism conditions, but also the rules of film viewing. Audiences no longer visited a multimedia show that was primarily staged at this side of the screen, now entered cinema just to see what happened on the screen, or at the other side of the screen, as one might say. Without the mediation of the thrill of watching movie was transformed from communal  happening between four walls into an exclusive relation between the film (maker) and the individual viewer. The capacity of the exhibitor or the audience to intervene in the communication process had been reduced to minimum. things, they

The Cinema Act in the Netherlands provides an illustration of these shifts. The Act had been drafted in the silent period and drew a fine distinction between silent were to be supervised by the central government, their verbal and musical presentation had to be controlled by local administrations. However; when the new technology transferred the production of sounds from the theatre to the studio, the control of sounds tended to shift from local to central government, as the latter was now in a position to check all elements of the presentation. However; the The consequences of this transfer of powers were debated at the highest political levels of government and Parliament in the Netherlands in 1930

## ADJUSTMENTS IN THE STUDIO

The introduction of sound marked of artistic experimentation in modernist as well as in classical filmmaking. Formal experiments could be found in Europe, particularly in the avant-garde movement,  though its output remained small. Interesting examples are Walter Ruttmann's Melodie der Welt (Germany, 1929), Dziga VerPhilips Radio (the Netherlands, 1931) These pictures have few traits in common.

The avant-garde cinema proved, however; to have a very restricted future, and it declinedwith thearrival ofsound This decline was not simply consequence of the new technology; as critics suggested at the time; the artistic that it was irreversible.

During this period traditional film-makers also made a real effort to innovate their artistic practice. Big studios in Hollywood and Berlin explored the possibilities of sound within the old narrative framework. To this end, For example building walls had to be made sound-proof, and the hissing arc lamps and the humming camera had to be silenced\_ To control the sound-recording process, the studio had to employ   personnel of different (notably electrical engineers) and to edit the film, new equipment had to be designed. they

The French film critic André Bazin stressed the continuity of style in a well-known essay from 1958, asking: of a new cinema?' (Bazin 1967). To answer his question, Bazin returns to silent cinema. According to him, two styles had coexisted in the silent period: one that priviscène. The former had dominated silent film-making, but the latter would become more prominent after the intro duction This emphasis on continuity in the transition from silent to sound cinema seems to be confirmed in later studies Sound stimulated stylistic inno vation, but within narrow limits.

In this way, the expressive  qualities of the microphone were tested and compared to those of the camera. The microphone would become the ear; as the camera had been the eye of the imaginary observer. Visual of view could be matched with aural camera distance with sound distance, visual depth with sound perspective. The vocabulary of film-making and criticism was extended with a set of concepts that sprang from this analogy of sound and image. bring point

The practice of musical illustration, almost perfected during the silent period, was more or less transplanted to the sound era.

Hollywood developed a wide diversity of speaking styles; from tough-talking gangsters like James Cagney to the double entendres of Mae West, and the absurd puns of Groucho Marx. This quality was lost in foreign countries where voices were dubbed; dubbing damaged the star system.

The American film industry would dominate the world in 1933 as it had 1928, with the exception of countries like Germany Italy; the Soviet Union that had imposed severe import restrictions on American films.In fact, sound ultimately stimulated internationalization, for the more films were produced as self be distributed internationally as complete commodities .

Some peculiar discontinuities should be pointed out too. Since 1932 the world that prefer dubbing and those that hate it and favour subtitling of films. These preferences have become deeply rooted in national viewing habits, and eventually were transferred to television. It is not always clear, however, on what grounds these choices Though dubbing is more expensive and can be processed profitably only in major language regions, the economic motive was not always decisive. Japan opted for subtitles; though dubbing would have been economically feasible in this densely populated country On the other hand, the choice in favour of dubbing was influenced by nationalist considerations in many countries, although the fear that the sounds of foreign languages in the cinema might corrupt the mother tongue as well as national culture appears to be unfounded in retrospect. The opposite might be the case since it can be argued that foreign languages in the cinema and on television lead to an intensified awareness of cultural identity. Subtitles are a continuous signal for the viewer that there is gap between the country of production and the place of reception. This signal is missing in dubbing. Dubbing facilitates the process of acculturation that goes hand in hand with the international diffusion of films, since culture is not only transmitted by words but by images as well. That is why there is little reason to suppose that cultural identity can be defended by excluding foreign languages from the screen The production and television pro has been

An important effect of the new technology was the revival of film production in many countries in response to the sudden demand for talking pictures in native languages. French cinema peaked with 157 feature films in 1932 after an all-time low of 52 in 1929, though the introduction of dubbing would bring the number down again.

Silent film art was discovered as an endangered heritage worth preserving for future generations. The importance of film archives was recognized, as a source of historical evidence and for aesthetic reasons. Nostalgia for the silent era came into being. Special cinemas were opened where one could see the masterpieces of the past, and the first histories of film as art were written: early attempts to define the canon of silent film, evaluating what belonged to the classical heritage and what did not. Here also begins the selection process that is typical of every historical enterprise: the tendency to forget what one did not want to see or hear in the past. For example; it was fifty years before it became possible to show a silent film as it had been presented originally in the cinema: accompanied by a live orchestra .

## Hollywood:\_The\_Triumph of the\_Studio\_System

## THE AMERICAN FILM INDUSTRY IN THE 19305

The 1920s had been a decade of tremendous growth and all   phases of production, distribution, and exhibition expanding rapidly as movie-going became the nation's and indeed much of the world's-preferred form of entertainment. Following the industry's conversion to sound films in 1927-8, the socalled 'talkie boom' capped this halcyon period, providing an additional market surge at the decade's end and further solidifying the dominant position of Hollywood's major studio powers. The talkie itself as 'Depression-proof' in the wake of Wall Street's momentous collapse in October 1929. and the American movie industry enjoyed its bestyearever in 1930 as theatre admissions , revenues, and studio profits reached record levelsgross

The Depression caught up with the movie industry in Between 1930 and 1933, theatre admissions fell from 90 million per week to only 60 million, gross industry revtheatres closed their doors in the early 1930s, leaving only about 15,300 in operation by 1935.Among the Hollywood powers, the Depression hit the Big Five integrated major studios especially hard because ofthe massive debt service Fox, and RKO-suffered financial collapse in the early Warner Bros. survived only by siphoning off only survived but prospered during the Depression due to its relatively limited chain of first-class metropolitan theatres, the deep pockets of powerful parent company Loew's Inc , and the quality of product turned out by its Culver City studio

Hollywood's three Universal, and United Artists (UA)fared somewhat better in the early 1930s. These companies produced top product and had their own nation-wide and overseas distribution operations, like the Big Five, but did not own theatre they

chains. While this had been tremendous disadvantage during the 1920s, it proved to be blessing during the Depression, since these studios avoided the related mortgage commitments. The major minors also adjusted their production and market strategies more effectively than the integrated majors company for the A-class productions ofits active founders (Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford , and Douglas Fairbanks) and for major independent producers like Sam Goldwyn and Joe Schenck, simply limited its output to about a dozen A-class pictures per annum. Columbia and Universal pursued very different course, gearing their new and

The rapid rise of the B movie and the was direct result of the Depression To attract patrons in those troubled economic times, most of the nation's theatres began showing two features per programme, and changed programmes two Or three times per week. The increased product demand was met largely via B movies Westerns Or action pictures, which about sixty were designed to play on double bills in subsequent-run theatres outside the major urban markets. Not surprisingly; this period saw the emergence of many companies which specialized in B pictures Referred to as these were straight production companies without distribution set-ups; released through the states rights system, farming out their films to small-time independent distributors on regional basis. A few of these B-picture studios, notably Monogram and Republic, notonly survived the Depression but became relatively important companies by the late 1930s . they

Bmovie   production was scarcely confined to the an important element in the studio system at All of the integrated majors produced Bs during the 1930s, with up to half of the output of Warners, RKO, and Fox into that category as the decade wore on While most of the major studios revenues came from Aclass features, the production of B movies enabled them to their studio and their contract per large. falling keep

new genres, and to ensure a regular supply of product.

The federal government, meanwhile; initiated an economic recovery programme during the Depression which enabled the major Hollywood powers to solidify their control of the industry The crucial factor here was the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt to the presidency in late 1932,and theimpact of FDR's National Industrial Recovery strategy; basically; was to promote recovery by condoning certain monopoly practices by major US industries including motion pictures. The studios now enjoyed what Tino Balio (1985) has termed 'government sanction for the trade practices that [the majors] had spent ten years developing through informal collusion' . Hollywood's own trade association, the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association (MPPDA), drafted the Code of Fair Competition required by the NIRA. This formally codified trade practices such as block booking, blind bidding, and ancial risks and maximized the profitability of their top features\_

While Bs and double bills helped the studios and exhibitors weather the early Depression years . the real key to success--was the intervention of both Wall Street and In fact, one might argue that Hollywood's classical era could not have occurred without the financial support of Wall Street and the government's economic recovery programme. New York financiers and banking firms had been involved with the movie industry's development since the early 1920s, particularly in the studios theatre chain expansion and conversion to sound. Wall Street's involvement increased significantly during the early 1930s, as various firms engineered and financed the reorganization of foundering studios and became more directly involved in their management and operations as well.

Another significant effect of the NIRA on the industry and particularly on studio production, was the rise of organized labour. To mitigate the potential for worker exploitation and abuse inherent in the recovery programme, the NIRA authorized labour organizing and coleffort reinforced by Congress via Labor Relations Board\_ Thus Hollywood evolved from essentially an open to a 'union town in the 1930s with the division and specialization offilm-making labour now mandated by the government and codified by the various unions and guilds. shop'

Beyond the government-mandated   regulation of the industry; the 1930s saw increasingly heavy regulation of Will Hays authorized the drafting of the Production Code;

a doctrine of ethics designed, according to its preamble to safeguard 'thelarger moral responsibility of the motion pictures Code enforcement was somewhat lax and inconsistent until 1933, when widespread public criticism of sex and violence in movies, especially by the newly created Catholic Legion of Decency; led Hays and the MPPDA to devise a means of formal self-censorship. The result was the Production Code Administration (PCA), an MPPDA agency which, under director Joseph Breen, regulated movie content. Beginning in 1934, PCA approval was required on all scripts before production and then on the was assigned a PCA seal prior to release

The extensive codification and regulation of the movie stabilized film-making   operations , and solidified the major studios' control of virtually every of the industry. By the late 1930s the eight  major studios the USA, which generated 90 per cent of all box-office revenues As distributors took in 95 per cent of all rental receipts. Hollywood films also accounted for an estimated 65 per cent of all films exhibited world-wide and roughly one-third of studio revenues throughout the which supplied nearly half of Hollywood's overseas revenues phase they

The five integrated majors, meanwhile, had solidified their dominant position via command of the crucial firstrun market. Taken together; the Big Five owned Or controlled about 2,600 'affiliated theatres in 1939; this was but it comprised over 80 per cent of metropolitan first-run theatres-that is, the de luxe town-centre houses in the largest cities with seating in the thousands which ran only top features operated and night, and generated the lion's share of industry revenues.

actual film production. The Depression-era collapse of five of the Big Eight studios gave several Wall Street firms the directors of these salvaged companies; directly to control particular studios and to impose their own notions of efficiency and sound business practices. These efforts had relatively little real impact, however, which is instructive in terms of studio ownership and management. As film historian Robert Sklar has pointed out in his analysis of studio control during the 1930s:

The ultimate issue is not who owns the movie companies but who manages them When several studios began to founder in the early Depression years, the outside interests who took them over were determined to play a direct role in running them, to demonstrate how practical business and financial minds could make money where movie men could not. By the end of the 1930s, however; all the studios were back under the management, if not theownership; ofmen experienced in the world of entertainment. (Sklar 1976)

is crucial, as has been demonstrated by film historians applying the tenets of neo classical economic theory. Balio, for example, argues that the ownership-management split which took hold in the 1930s indicated that the studios had developed into modern business enterprises. 'As grew in size' , writes Balio, the studios rationalized and organized operations into autonomous departments headed by professional manager' The studio founders themselves either became full-time career managers'~as with the Cohns (at Columbia) and quished direct control to salaried executives. And as Balio notes, most of the chief executives appointed during the 1930s who successfully managed the studios had backgrounds in either distribution orexhibition; management of actual film-making operations was invariably left to salaried executives with direct production experience. they : they

These refinements in top management of the motion picture companies during the 1930s were accompanied by equally   important adjustments in production supervision.

Each was crucial to feature output as well as its overall operations, and each left UA due to difficulties with its still-active founding partners, Chaplin and Pickford. Thus while makers enjoyed more autonomy as unit producers than and particularly in 1940-1 during Goldwyn's bitter battle (and much-publicized lawsuit) with Chaplin and Pickford, which resulted in Goldwyn releasing through RKO. and

One notable exception to this shift to productionunit system in the 1930s was 2Oth Century-Fox. In 1933 independent producer Joe Schenck convinced Warners' production chief, Darryl Zanuck, to leave the studio and

Twentieth released through UA and provided roughly half its output in 1934-5, but Schenck and Zanuck broke with UA in 1935 when Chaplin and Pickford refused to make them full partners. Twentieth then merged with the (previously bankrupt) Fox Film Corporation, with Schenck and Zanuck forming a twoman studio management team and Zanuck reverting to the role he had played at Warners of central producer:

Columbia Pictures was also a notable exceptionin terms of studio management in the 1930s, although here the distinction involved the owners and top executives. Until the early 1930s Columbia's ownership and executive control operated much like Warners, in that the company and operated by brothers-Jack and Harry Cohn (along with founding partner Joe Brandt) and the siblings executive roles reflected the relations of power within the industry. As with Warners, the older brother (in this with Joe Brandt) ran the New York offce as the senior executive, while vice president and younger sibling Harry Cohn ran the studio\_ When Brandt retired in 1931, however, power struggle ensued; Harry prevailing, thanks largely to the supportof A with Harry Cohn as president and Jack as vice-president handling marketing and sales out of New York, only major producer-distributor whose studio boss was also the chief executive of the company.

In fact Zanuck, having risen through the writers' ranks at Warners, was the only 'creative executive' running studio in the late 1930s, and the only top studio executive an active hand in actual would continue well into the 1950s. Zanuck personally supervised all of Fox's Aclass pictures, from such revenuegenerating hokum' (Zanuck's own term) as the Tyrone Power adventureromances to its acclaimed 'John Ford pictures with contract star Henry Fonda: Drums the Mohawk (1938), Young Mr; Lincoln (1939), and The Grapes of Wrath (1940). meanwhile, Zanuck had been replaced by Hal Wallis, who along with Jack Warner orchestrated steady shift to unit production in the late 1930s, although Howard Hawks) rather than producers were the key unit personnel. along

the industry's vertically integrated structure. The co-ordination of market strategies, management structure, and production operations was in fact the essential feature of the Hollywood studio system-it was the basis for what Tino Balio has termed the 'grand design' of 1930s Hollywood, and for what André Bazin has aptly termed the 'genius ofthe system' of classical Hollywood film-making.

The primary studio product course, which accounted for over 90 per cent of the $150 million invested in Hollywood film production in 1939. production at the eight major studios included both Aclass pictures and B movies, with the proportion of As to Bs dependent on the company's resources, theatre holdings (or lack thereof) and general market strategy. The majors also turned out occasional 'prestige pictures that is bigger   and more expensive   features, usually released on with increased admission prices and reserved seating. As the economic recovery took hold and as market conditions best exemplified by major independent productions like Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1938) and Selznick's Gone with the Wind (1939), along with ambitious studio productions such as MGMs The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Paramount's Cecil B. DeMille epics like Union Pacific (1939) and North West Mounted Police (1940)

were fundamentally at odds with the market structure and trade practices of the studio eraThe most crucial commodity in classical Hollywood, without question, was the Aclass   feature, and particularly the routine star vehicle' . Each studio's 'star stable was its most visible and valuable resource an inventory of genre variations which drove its entire operation. Indeed, there was studio's assets and profits, its stable of contract stars, and the number of star-genre formulas in its repertoire~ranging from the talent-laden MGM, which boasted 'all the stars in the heavens to companies like RKO, Columbia, and Universal, which had only one or two top stars under contract and turned out only a halfdozen or so Aclass pictures per year. Each company constructed its entire production and marketing strategy around its established star-genre formulations, which dominated the first-run market and generated the majority of studio revenues. Aclass star vehicles also provided veritable insurance policies not only with the public but also with the unaffiliated theatres that subject to block booking, in that company's top features 'carried' its entire annual programme of pictures .

Each studio's Aclass star-genre formulations also keyed coalesced around its steady output of crime dramas and gangster films with James Cagney and Edward G.

The contract talent and resources necessary to sustain these formulas extended well beyond a studio's star stable, of course In fact, with the development of the unitproduction trend during the 1930s, the studios tended to form collaborative 'units" around these star-genre formulas And while studio's stars were crucial to the formulation of its house style, the chief architects of that style were production executives and top producers. As Leo Rosten noted in his landmark 1941 study, its

Each studio has a personality; each studio's product shows special emphases and values. And, in the final analysis, the sum total of studio's personality; the aggregate pattern of its choices and its tastes, may be traced to its producers. For it is the producers who establish the preferences, the prejudices, and the predispositions of the organization and, therefore, of the movie which it turns out

In some cases, production units were informal and fluid, changing somewhat from one star-genre for mulation to the next, while in other cases the units were remarkably consistent, particularly in terms of directors , writers, cinematographers , composers, and other key creative roles . Not units (and the pictures turned to be most consistent in the realm of low-budget film-making, especially on the series pictures which comprised roughly 1930s and early 1940s. These were produced with ruthless, factory-like efficiency; invariably under the supervision of particular producer. they

Some A-class star-genre formulas attained series as well, and also were turned Marlene Dietrich films via the Josef von Sternberg unit, its Joe Pasternak unit. But while unit production brought economy and efficiency even to high-end studio output, it was not necessarily rigid or mechanical process-an important concern regarding Aclass pictures, given the demand for product differentiation. Indeed, under the right circumstances and given adequate resources, unit production proved

responsive to changes in both audience tastes and studio personnel\_

For an illuminating example of studiobased unit prolevel, consider the late-1930s emergence at MGM ofthe so'Freed unit' and of a new musical featuring Garland. Rooney's star was already in rapid ascent at the time, largely to yet another unit-based star-genre formula, MGM's Hardy Family pictures In 1937 Rooney was cast as the middle class , middle-American couple (Lionel Barrymore and Spring   Byington)  in modest comedy-drama, Family Afjfair. Audiences responded and exhibitors clamoured for more, so Mayer replaced Barrymore and Byington with two lesser stars , Lewis Stone and Holden, low-budget unit to develop a series. Cohn assembled B Seitz, writer Van Riper, cinematographer Lew White, et al., which turned out a new Hardy instalment every few months from 1938 to 1941.

While an ideal vehicle for Rooney; the series also provided a context for trying out new talent, particularly contract ingénues who could serve as a friend Or 'love interest" for Andy. Besides Ann Rutherford became a regular in 1938, the series enjoyed guest appearances from such emerging Metro stars as Lana Turner; Ruth Hussey, Donna Reed, Kathryn Grayson, and most these ingénues had an introduced musical dimension to the series and thus brought out quite another facet of Rooney' s character and talent top

in 1938. A surprisingly strong boxoffice hit, even for Hardy film, it suggested that MGM might have new musical team on its roster. Garland's success in the Hardy musical also confirmed Mayer's decision to give her the lead in The Wizard of Oz (in a role initially conceived for Shirley Temple; whom MGM planned to borrow from Fox). Oz was MGM's biggest risk and most expensive picture of the decade; costing $2.77 million to produce and tying up five sound stages and hundreds of personnel for twentytwo weeks of shooting. But remarkably   enough, considering the film's subsequent success as a perennial television event in the USA, Oz was not big commercial hit

but due to its high production and marketing costs it actually lost about $1 million\_

While a range of factors and events were involved in that process, two were of principal importance in 1940studios, and the outbreak of war overseas. The antitrust campaign actually had been brewing for several years, beginning in earnest in July 1938 when the US Justice Department filed suit against the Big Eight studios on behalf of the nation's independent theatre owners for the movie  industry The government's objectives in the socalled 'Paramount case' (named after The studios managed to the US attorneys at until early 1940, when the case At that RKO) signed consent decree ~essentially plea of no contest and compromise with the government. The studios agreed to limit block booking to groups ofno more than five pictures, to end blind bidding by holding trade screenings of all features, and to modify their run-zoneisfied either the independent exhibitors Or the Justice Department; both vowed to keep the Paramount case alive through appeals, and to continue the anti-trust campaign. keep

Meanwhile; the outbreak and escalation ofwar overseas threatened to devastate Hollywood's vital overseas trade The studios exports to the Axis nations-principally 1937-8, but still Hollywood derived roughly one-third of its total revenues from overseas markets The primary overseas client was Europe, which supplied about 75 per centofthe studios' foreign income in 1939,and the United Kingdom in particular, alone providing 45 per cent. Those markets were severely disrupted by the outbreak of war across Europe eliminated one foreign market after another in 1940, culminating in the fall of France in June. By late 1940 Britain stood virtually alone against Germany in the west--and it stood alone as Hollywood's only sig nificant remaining overseas market as well. key

The War in Europe induced the US government to initiate massive military and defence buildup; which had tremendous impact on the movie industry. While the buildup promised an eventual boost to Hollywood's domestic market, the short-term effects were primarily negative. The government financed its defence

Many of these were related to the unprecedented demand for top product, which resulted from both the 1940 Consent Decree (with the defence buildup (with its overheated first-run markets)

By 1941 both Hollywood and the nation had shifted into more pronounced mode, as Axis aggression solidified US support of Britain and rendered American intervention all but inevitable. On the domestic front, the defence buildup went high gear,   signalling the definitive end of the Depression the onset of a 'war boom' for the American movie industry. Hollywood stepped up its warrelated production in 1941, including features with clear interventionist and 'preparedness' themes The public was clearly buying; five of the top ten box-office hits in 1941 were war related, topped by Sergeant York (Warner Bros. 1941) and Charlie Chaplin's late-1940 UA release The Great Dictator.

The growing power ofindependent film-makers and contract talent in the early 1940s was reinforced by the concurrent rise of the talent guilds-that is, the Screen studios Actors Guild (formally recognized by the in 1938), the Screen Directors Guild (recognized in 1939), and the Screen Writers Guild (recognized in 1941) The top talent represented yet another serious challenge to studio over their work. Moreover; top contract talent was 'going freelance' in unprecedented numbers in 1940-1 dueto the demand for A-class product and the shift to independent production, as well as the considerable tax advantages involved in avoiding salaried income and crea inde pendent production companies. This further undermined the long-standing factor in studio hegemony and in efficient studio production. top guilds

Meanwhile, all ofthe studios also saw a marked increase in the number of 'hyphenates' under contract in 1940 1-notably writers and directors who attained producer status The most aggressive studio in this  regard was Paramount, which elevated director Mitchell  Leisen to producer-director and to writerwhile the writing team of Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett was recast as a writer-producer (Brackett) significant-and most forward-looking-move along these lines, Paramount not only granted Cecil B DeMille the status of an 'in-house independent producer; but gave him a profit-participation deal on his pictures as well.

Thus Hollywood was on the verge of a sea-change in late 1941, with the studios' control of both production and exhibition facing serious challenges . The crisis mentality was underscored by sociologist Leo Rosten in Hollywood: The Movie Colony; an influential, in-depth industry analysis published in November 1941. Lamenting what he termed the 'end ofHollywood's lush and profligate period' , Rosten surveyed the range of concerns and crises facing the studios at the time:

Other businesses have   experienced onslaughts   against   their beginning. No moving picture leader can be sanguine before the steady challenge of unionism; collective bargaining, the consent decree (which brought the Department of Justice suit to a temporary armistice) the revolt of the independent theater owners, the trend toward increased taxation, the strangulation of the foreign market, and a score of frontal attacks on the citadels of the screen.

## WAR BOOM

Rosten's assessment is notable for two principal reasons: first, its accurate inventory of the deepening industry crises in 1940-1, and second, how completely those crisis conditions would change within only weeks of the book's War. With America suddenly engaged in global war, industrial fortunes changed virtually   overnight.  Among the more acute ironies of the period-and there were many-was Hollywood's sudden rapport with government that now saw the 'nationalcinema as an ideal sourceofdiversion, information; and propaganda for citizens and soldiers alike. In the months after the USA entered the war, Hollywood's from its studio-factories to its popular genres and cinematic forms, were effectively retooled for war production. Within a year of Pearl Harbor were war related , as were the vast majority of its newsreels and documentaries.

notably Bob Hope, Betty Grable, Greer Garson, Abbott and Costello and Humphrey Bogart. Traditional genres (particularly the musical) were converted to the wareffort, while Hollywood's long-standing bias for 'love stories was to perform their respective patriotic duties. There were significant stylistic adjustments during the war as well. Hollywood's war-related features , particularly the combat film,   employed quasi-documentary   techniques which were altogether distinctive for American cinema. And in something of stylistic and thematic counter to the wood also cultivated darker and anti-social vision in urban crime films and female Gothic' melo dramas steeped in style which post-war critics would term film noir.

Thus the war was period of massive paradox for the movie industry; and especially for the Hollywood studios Granted reprieve of sorts by the Justice Department 'for the duration' the studios reasserted their control of the movie market-place during the war and enjoyed record revenues, while playing a vital role in the US war effort. The nation's wholesale conversion to war production sustained Hollywood's warboom' for five years, with millions of defence plant workers concentrated in major urbanindustrial centres pushing weekly theatre attendance to its record pre-Depression levels .

fuelled by returning servicemen, the lifting of wartime restrictions, and a wideopen global market-place starved of Hollywood product. But as box-office revenues and studio profits reached staggering levels in 1946, the 'drive against Hollywood that Rosten had described in 1941 resumed with a vengeance. In fact, the mood in Hollywood grew decidedly downbeat in 1946 due to deepening labour strife, the renewed anti-trust campaign, the threats of 'protectionist' policies in major foreign markets. Moreover;, the studios faced host of distinctly post-war woes at home, from suburban migration and the rise of comcrusades With each passing month in the post-war era it and the classical cinema that it had engendered were rapidly coming to an end. and

## Censorship and\_Self-Regulation

When applied to cinema, the term 'censorship' often conflates two distinct practices: governmentally administered systems of control over the expression of 'political ideas in flm; and systems of self-regulation operated by entertainment cinema industries to ensure that the content of films conforms to the moral, social, and ideological mores State, have not been prominent features of twentiethcentury liberal democracies, and the routine supervision of film content by state institutions-censorship as a form of official criticism-has been largely the other hand, can be understood as a form of market censorship; in which those forces in controlof the production process determine what may and may not be produced. The most effective form of market censorship prevents movies from being made rather than suppressing them after production, but in either guise, censorship is a pracand representations circulating in particular culture. Because cinema has been an international   industry almost from its inception, the two forms of censorship have constantly interacted to reinforce each other. But Hollywood's international dominance has also meant that its form of self-regulation has been the most important censorship practice in cinema history. explicit,

## THE ORIGINS OF FILM CENSORSHIP

Although film has always been more closely regulated than other forms of communication, cinema censorship cannot be directly equated with censorship of the press OF other publications, because, for most of their history films have not been granted legally protected status as speech. In a 1915 decision that established the legal status declared the exhibition of motion pictures to be 'a business   pure originated and conducted for profit' , and not to be regarded as part of the press of the country Or as organs of public opinion' . were thus not protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, but liable to prior censorship by state and municiauthorities. This legal definition of cinema as outside the spheres of politics and art is itself an implicit of censorship As a result debates over the regulation of cinema have been primarily concerned with questions of whether the entertainment it provided had harmful They pal form

Both the basis on which the censorship of cinema was justified and the mechanisms by which it would be practised were already well established by the time of the Supreme Court's judgement. Although the details of censorship procedures varied from nation to nation, there was striking similarity in the evolution of those mechanisms in the countries of Europe, the Americas, and Australasia. In the nineteenth century most of these countries divided public entertainment performances into two categories regulative purposes. What was often called 'legitimate theatre was distinguished from what was known in France as spectacles de curiosité, category of commercialized amusement that included marionettes\_ cafés-concerts, magic shows , panoramas, animal exhibitions, and all travelling shows which lack either a persolid structure' In France, for example; theatrical censorship ceased in 1906, but because cinema was classed as spectacle its performances were still for

The regulation of content was something of an afterthought to these environmental concerns. The principal anxieties were created by the fact thatnickelodeons were hot, dark places, where children in particular might be 'influenced for evil by the conditions surrounding some of these shows' . public they gaffs

The proliferation of local controls over cinema exhibition led to the establishment of national institutions of industrial selfregulation in the United States, Britain, and 1908, municipal safety regulations were being widely used as the pretext practice which was strongly opposed by the emerging national distribution industries \_ because such regulations interfered with the circulation of their product. The symbiotic relationship between the regulation of film content and the development of mono opoly structures within the industry is best illustrated by public for

Such narrative strategies demonstrated the 'respectability' of moving pictures as an instrument for both ordering and explaining a dominant ideology; and there was an implicit political censorship in insisting on the triumph of virtue. Moving Picture World objected to a 1912 movie that ended with 'the villain   unrepentant and unpunished and the in their same, sad situation' , because 'subjects ofthis character are calculated to arouse class prejudices unless treated in the most delicate manner and it is open to question if can result from accentuating the social differences of the people' . poor good

## HOLLYWOOD AND SELF-REGULATION

Although in most countries the function of censorship was undertaken by a government-appointed agency; there was invariably a large element ofindustry participation in the process The aim ofcensorship was to exhibition rather than to prohibit it, and both distributors and exhibitors recognized that it was in their economic interest to co-operate with established censorship practices\_ Self-regulation was thus justified as an anticipatory form of cooperation, as circumventing demands for more extensive governmental regulation of the industry. police

In the early days, the preoccupations of censors varied: the Dutch and Scandinavian boards were more concerned by violence than by sexual themes, while Australian and South African censors tended to be noticeably more puritanical than the British Board.

In August 1921 the Federal Trade Commission run exhibition, and there were calls for the Senate Judiciary Committee to conduct an into the political activities of the motion picture industry. These events led to the creation in March 1922, of the Motion Inc. (MPPDA), with former Postmaster-General Will as its president Hays

Hays sought to persuade his employers that could not 'ignore the classes that write, talk, and legislate' their satisfactory level of entertainment for their diverse audiences , but also to offend as small proportion and legislative leadership as possible. His public relations policyaffiliated the MPPDA with nationally federated civic teacher associations, aiming to contain the legislative threat posed by their political lobbying power. To establish self-regulation as a form of industrial self-determination, the industry had to demonstrate that, as Hays it, 'the quality of our pictures is such that no reasonable person can claim any need of censorship' . In part he achieved this by conceding that there was no dispute over the need to regulate entertainment or over the standards by which it should be regulated, only over who possessed the apprO: authority to they put police priate

Resisting the spread of state censorship and regulating movie content was only one aspect of the MPPDA's overall task of internally reorganizing the industry's affairs. The process of vertical integration had been exploited  by reform groups and had also undermined the confidence ofWall Street in the competenceofindustry management. The Hollywood scandals of 1920 and 1921 led the industry to be regarded as a site of moral as well as economic extravagance. Hays persuaded industry leaders that public relations operation to reorient the industry's image, and he constructed the MPPDA as the instrument to resolve the contradictions of efficiently restricting Hollywood's extravagance. they

In 1927, the Association published code to govern production, administered by its Studio Relations Committee (SRC) in Hollywood.

The technological complexities of sound production necessitated a more exact arrangement. Unlike silent film talkies could not be altered by local censors, distributors , or individual exhibitors without destroying synchronization. Producers began to demand something firmer than advice from the SRC, but at the same time wanted to establish a more permissive code for sound. But their desire to 'bring Broadway to Main Street ~ ran counter to the hostility of an increasingly insecure Protestant provincial middle class.

They insisted that the only way federal regulation of the industry they

Under attack from several directions, Hays seized on the 'regulation of film content as an area where the Association might be able to demonstrate its usefulness to both the public and its members . In September 1929 he initiated the revision of the 1927 code, and committee of producers presented a draft code in November. A quite

separate document emanated from Chicago, where Martin Quigley; a prominent Chicago Catholic involved in the Association proposed a much more elaborated Code enunciating the moral principles underlying screen entertainment. He recruited Jesuit, Father Daniel Lord,

The director of the SRC, Colonel Jason Joy; spentJanuary 1930 attempting to compromise the two drafts and their producers' rewrote Lord's draft as separate document entitled 'Reasons Underlying the Code' With the consent of both parties, Catholic involvement in the Code remained secret, as the Resolution for Uniform Interpretation; which placed responsibility for making changes in finished films with the companies concerned. It also appointed 'jury' composed of the heads of production of each of the member companies as final arbiters of whether a film conformed 'to the spirit and the letter of the Code' . This caution in publicly committing the Association totheCode's enforcement had as much to do with recognition of the practical problems of the Code's application as it did with ticism about producers' intentions

The text of the Code provided a list of prohibitions rather than the moral arguments of Lord's original draft. Its 'Particular Applications' elaborated the 'Don'ts and Be and obscenity. Lord's contribution was most visible in the that preceded the Applications'

- No picture shall be produced which will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience shall never be thrown to the side of crime, wrongdoing, evil or sin

Although growing chorus of voices denounced the that movies became more salacious Or vicious between the case. Ihe early 1930s was period of moral servatism in American culture and elsewhere, and both the SRC and state censors applied increasingly strict stan-dards\_ The industry's most vociferous critics tended to judge the movies on their advertising, which was less strictly   controlled than their contents , and small number of visible infringements were sufficient to fuel the flames of their righteousness. far

Joy's approach to the improvement of content was gradualist. He thought the 'small,

negotiate strategies of representation that permitted producers 'to paint the unconventional, the unlawful, the immoral side of life in order to out in immediate contrast the happiness and benefits derived from whole some, clean and law-abiding conduct' . He recognized if the Code was to remain effective; it had to allow the studios to develop system of   representational ventions 'from which conclusions might be drawn by the sophisticated mind, but which would mean nothing to the unsophisticated and inexperienced' . Particularly in the early years of its operation, much of the work of the Production Code lay in the creation and maintenance of this system of conventions. Like other Hollywood conventions , the Code was one of several substitutes for detailed audience research\_ Having chosen not to dif ferentiate its product through a duction industry had to find ways of appealing to both and 'sophisticated sensibilities in the same object without transgressing the boundaries of public acceptability. This involved devising systems and codes of representation in which 'innocence was inscribed into the text while sophisticated viewers were able to 'read into movies whatever as producers could use the Production Code to that had put them there. As Lea Jacobs (1991) has argued, under the Code 'offensive ideas could survive at the price of an instability of meaning there was constant negotiation about how explicit films could be and by what means (through the image, sound, language) offensive ideas could find representation' . bring that, ratings ong deny they

The crime film had been the subject of the municipal censorship as early as 1907, and the genre was regarded as the most threatening to the brief of gangster films inspired by press coverage of Al Capone revived charges that the movies were encouraging young audiences to view the gangster protagonist as 'hero-villain' , and proved relations calamity the Association. In September 1931 Code procedures were considerably tightened, submission of scripts was made compulsory; and further production of gangster films was But every time the Association responded to one kind of complaint, it was replaced by another. As soon as Joy was provided with the means to ensure the morality of a movie's narrative, reformers argued that the stories Hollywood told were not the primary source of its influence. The cinema's power to corrupt was now assumed to lie in the seductive pleasure of its spectacle, exemplified in the screen careers of Jean Harlow, Mae West, and the actress Father Lord described as 'the unspeakable Constance Bennett' . public cycle public for overall

constituted a significant shift away from Joy's attempts at consensus. In September Joy left to become producer at Fox, and his replacement, James Wingate, proved unable to establish rapport with any of the studio heads, and too much attention to details of elimination rather than wider thematic concerns. Joy's resignation coincided with the first publication of extracts from the Payne Fund Studies , a research programme investigating children's attendance at and emotional responses to motion pictures , undertaken by the Motion Picture Research Council   (MPRC), which had become the focal point of Protestant and educational concerns about the cultural effects of the movies. A widely circulated sensationalized digest of the Studies, Henry James Forman's Our Movie Made   Children, made the MPRCs demands for federal regulation profound threat to the industry. By the end educational organizations had passed resolutions calling for federal regulation of the industry paid

to achieve precise objective: the effective enforcement of the Production Code by the existing   machinery. Although its principal weapon appeared to be the economic one of a threatened boycott of films or theatres, its real power in its capacity to generate publicity It was designed not to inflict major economic damage. It was, indeed, vital to its success that it separate the question of Code enforcement from issues of industry trade practice like block booking, in order to differentiate the Legion from the MPRC and make it clear that the bishops had no purpose Or desire to tell the picture people how to run their business' . It was a complete success. In June the MPPDA Board revised the Resolution for Uniform Interpretation. The SRC was renamed the Production Code Administration (PCA), with Breen as its director and an augmented staff. The producers' jury was eliminated, leaving appeal to the MPPDA Board as the only mechanism for questioning Breen's judgement. Each film passed by the PCA would be given seal, displayed on every print. All member companies agreed not to distribute or release film without certificate. A penalty clause imposed $25,000 fine for violation of the new Resolution. lay

Breen was also in almost constant conspiratorial COr respondence with Quigley and other   prominent Catholics, attempting to involve the Church hierarchy in demonstration of Catholic cultural assertiveness. By November 1933 had persuaded the Catholic bishops to in April 1934 the Committee announced it would recruit Legion of Decency; whose members would sign a pledge promising 'to remain away from all motion pictures except those which do not offend decency and Christian morality' The Legion was not spontaneous expression of 'public feeling. Its campaign was delicately orchestrated they

The early months of 1933 comprised the low point ofthe and insisted that more than economic action was required to deal with the crisis. Only a more rigid enforcement of the Code, he argued, could maintain public sympathy and defeat the pressure for federal intervention. He persuaded the Board to sign a Reaffirmation of Objectives threatened 'standards of production, standards of quality; standards of business practice' , and pledged them to the maintenance of 'higher business standards' . The Reaffirmation became the implement with which began to reorganize the SRC. The tone of its his producers , to this time, we were told 'it is recommended" but recently letters definitely state, "it is inadmissible' Or something equally definite Breen relinquished his other work to concentrate full-time on self regulation; and established his usefulness to the companies by doing what Wingate apparently could not: pro viding  practical solutions to studio's   problem in From August 1933 he was in effect running the SRC.

Given the public attention being to the campaign, it was in the industry's best interests to make a show of atonement. Industry publicity emphasized the scale of the 1934 crisis in order to create dividing line between 'before when the SRC had been unable to control production, and 'now' when PCA 'self-regulation had really become effective. As a result of this need for a act of contrition; the history of the SRCs gradual implementation of the Production Code was concealed behind more apocalyptic account. The immediate purpose behind this exaggeration was less to the Catholics (although the Legion of Decency remained powerful influence at the PCA) than to outmanœuvre those still demanding federal regulation of the industry But in fact, Breen had largely won the internal battle by March, when a definite willingness most recalcitrant of the major companies in their attitude to to be brought into line With the implementation of the agreement in mid-July; conditions tightened further. As in March 1933,a number were withheld from release, and drastic reconstruction undertaken: the conversion of Mae West's It Ain't no Sin into Belle of the Nineties (1934) the most prominent. A number of films then in circulation were withdrawn before the end of their release many more were refused certification over the next few years when companies attempted to rerelease them.

biographies resulted directly from the requirements of the industry's public relations.

Breen's insistence that the PCA was 'regarded by producers, directors, and their staffs, as participants in the was perfectly accurate. Beyond the shared assumption that the PCA functioned as an aid, notahindrance; to production, there were two underlying

The establishment of the PCA did not end discussion over what constituted satisfactory material for films Writers and producers commonly left material that knew would be cut in scripts sent to the PCA, often in hopes of it as a bargaining tool to something else through, and frequently shots or sequences that the PCA initially objected to survived into the final film. In 1935 disputes over the representation of crime resurfaced with the attempt by several studios to circumvent the prohibition on gangster films in the G-Men until British censors objected to the trend\_ On the whole however; these questions of Code enforcement were rela tively studios had acquiesced to with occasional displays of resistance; acquiesced to its decisions More importantly, opinion had generally recovered from its moral panic and accepted the Association's or the Legion's account of the industry's rescue from the abyss in 1934. they get cycle, public

considerations that governed its working operation. 'Compensating moral values" as understood by Breen, ensured not only that lower the moral standards of those who see it', but also that a calculus of retribution would invariably be deployed to punish the guilty. Plots had to be morally unambiguous in their development; dialogue, and conclusion, s0 the were represented in such a way that a pre existent knowledge was required to gain access to them screen-writer Elliott Paul pithily observed, 'A scene should give full play to the vices ofthe audience, and still have a technical out:' As

The difficulties the Association faced over film content in the late 1930s were largely the results of its success. As his dealings with the studios became more assertive after 1934, Breen's correspondence made fewer   distinctions between a decision under the Code, advice regarding the likely of state foreign censors, and the implementation of 'industry policy' in response to pressure groups, foreign governments, and corporate interests Industry policy was, like selfregulation; designed to prevent the movies becoming a subject of controversy or giving offence to powerful interests, but events such as MGM's decision in 1936 not to produce

## INTO AND AFTER THE WAR

Distinctly less trivial were the issues raised by the increaspolitical tensions in Europe and the world at large. In the United States itself directly political censorship was mostly confined to the banning of some Soviet films by state censor boards Newsreels were generally exempted from state censorship, but were made with firm degree of self-regulation; avoiding the coverage of crime as well as political controversy Meanwhile Nazi Germany and Fascist   Italy had instituted severe censorship; aimed not only at regulating the (mainly escapist) content of domestic production but at controlling the content of American and other imports, while Japan and the Soviet Union not only practised internal censorship but had become effectively closed markets. Throughout to the rise of Fascism was one of economically motivated appeasement; aimed at ensuring that its films would not attract the attention of foreign censors and so lead to the further acquired the screen rights to Robert E. Delight; which took place during the outbreak of a new European war brought about by an Italian invasion of project posed to their European distribution, both the studio and the PCA engaged in protracted negotiations with Italian diplomats in the USA to devise storyline that contained nothing that would offend the Italian government. The movie's generalized anti-war theme lost the play's specific indictment of Fascist aggression, and the natives of what prOducer Hunt Stromberg called the 'nondescript' European country in which the movie was set spoke Esperanto; not Italian. Production delays, caused in part by these nego tiations, meant that Idiot's Delight was not released until early 1939. they

By that time, however; the worsening crisis meant that markets were closed anyhow; and the resulting loss of revenue eroded the economic logic behind the industry's earlier policies of appeasement to the Nazi and Fascist regimes. David 0. the industry should abandon the outmoded' Code, but the PCA's censorship of the movies became a political issue primarily as result of the antithe major companies by the Departagainst

In 1939 the PCAs jurisdiction was restricted so that there was a clear distinction between its administration of the Code and its other advisory functions One effect of this was to acquiesce in the use of politically more controversial content as a way of demonstra that the 'freedom of the screen was not hampered by the operations of the PCA. Although PCA officials continued to voice concern over whether subjects as Confessions of a Nazi Spy (1939) constituted appropriate screen entertainment, they were much more circumspect in expressing their opinions. they ating Iting such

1930s had resulted in some relaxation ofits earlier rigidity over politically controversial subjects. During the government agencies in both Britain and the USA worked in parallel with the industry's   self-regulatory bodies rather than replacing them. In Britain, the Ministry of Information (MOI) had Censorship Division, but it del egated its 'security' film censorship of both feature films and newsreels to an augmented BBFC, which also retained power to suppress movies, although it never used it. In the USA, the Office of War Information (OWI) set up Bureau of Motion Pictures , which had no powers of censorship over Hollywood, but sought to establish parallel system ofscript supervision to the PCA's, in order to insert themes promoting the war effort. Under Joe Breen, the PCA remained politically as well as morally conservative, Moscow was brushed aside by the liberal OWI. The studios cooperated with the propaganda programme so as it did not put their profits at risk. They were however, over-represented both frivolity and American government reviewers   objected to the Preston Sturges comedy The Palm Beach (1942) as 'a libel on America at war as strongly as did to movies in which gangster heroes joined up. The OWI achieved its greatest influence after 1943, when military victories began to open up overseas markets again; and studios needed the approval of the government's separate Office of Censorship to export their product.

the OW had found way of demonstrating that censorship was 'smartshowmanship' . According to historians Clayton   Koppes and Gregory the OWT's involvement in Hollywood was 'the most comprehensive and sustained government attempt to change the content of a mass medium in American history' , since it told the industry not only what material should be omitted but also what should be included.

ground during the war, partly because of the imperatives of other agendas: the BBFC refrained almost entirely from making cuts in British, American Or even Soviet propafilms, even when transgressed the principles applied before 1939. Some of Hollywood's wartime productions including Double Indemnity (1944), Duel in the Sun (1946), and The Postman Always Twice (1946), required significant concessions from the PCA's pre-war standards not simply in the details of what showed, but also in their thematic preoccupations In other respects, however, the war saw little change. The OWI was unwilling for Hollywood to represent social problems unless it showed a solution for them and this coincided with PCA standards and studio practice. Studios had, always staged the performances of black musical artists in such way that their routines could be deleted by local censors in Southern states without disrupting the continuity of the movie\_ ganda they Rings they

The war'$ end however; brought rapid changes. Germany and Japan were subject to a military censorship imposed by the occupying forces; and, along with Italy; to heavy influx of American movies, as Hollywood sought opportunities to continue to profit from its patriotism. A Fox executive expressed the widely-held opinion that 'the motion picture must continue as an articulate force in the post-war world so that it can contribute vitally to and security on global basis complained at the thematic restrictions imposed on them by the Production Code After the PCA withdrew its seal from The Outlaw in 1946, Howard Hughes's legal challenge censorship; but it was clear that even in the reactionary political climate of the early Cold War the ground gained during the war would not be surrendered. As well as the more explicit representations of sexual and psychological variation and psychopathic violence in film noir, movies dealing with racial prejudice challenged the legitimacy on Pinky and Lost Boundaries (both 1949) were overturned by the Supreme Court, which declared in its ruling on the Paramount anti-trust case in 1948 that it now regarded movies as 'included in the press whose freedom is guaranteed by the First Amendment' . It was not, however; until 1952 that the Court reversed its 1915 ruling on the con-

stitutional status of cinema, in a case in which Rossellini's The Miracle (1948) had been banned by the New York censor board on the grounds of its being 'sacrilegious Over the next three years the Supreme state and municipal censorship unconstitutional on any grounds other than that of 'obscenity'

In the United States, the Supreme Court's decision in The Miracle case weakened the authority of the Production Code, but did not destroy it, although in 1953 a Maryland court observed that 'if the Production Code were law, it would be plainly unconstitutional' . The PCA had relied on the sanction of 'political censorship' , and the lib eralization of standards in both America and Europe eroded that sanction. However, the Court's decision in the

In Britain the changing attitude to cinema was embodied in the 1952 Cinematograph Act, which placed greater emphasis on regulation in the interests of chil dren, and coincided with the introduction of the 'X' category to replace the certificate. The 'X' certificate permitted the exhibition of movies with more sexually themes, generally of European origin. State censorship in most of continental Europe had always denced more concern with violence than with sex, and this distinction became more pronounced after 1950. In Britain and the USA, the growth of the 'art-house' circuits provided exhibition outlets for these products in a context that challenged the appropriateness of censorship for adults The liberalization of censorship standards in the 1950s had much to do with the precipitous decline in attendance: as cinema came to be viewed as something other than a form of mass entertainment for an undif ferentiated audience, many of the fundamental justifications ofits censorship lost their persuasive daring power.

## The Sound of Music

The history of music for sound films falls into two distinct periods: the first extending from 1925 to 1960, the second from 1960 to the present. In terms of style, there are great aesthetic goals, economic conditions, techniques. If the division is somewhat arbitrary it does reflect the fact that certain approaches to film-scoring were consistently followed from the 1930s to the 1950s only to be challenged and replaced by more modern' practices from the 1960s to the 1980s. Moreover, within the earlier period one finds three linked phases of develop ment: wide-rangingexperiment in the late 1920s and early 1930s, stylistic and technological standardization from half that followed, a steady broadening of film music's functional and expressive potential.

THE SPECTRUM OF INNOVATION 1926-1935

In the beginning was not the word but music, and initially from silents, save for their fixed, synchronized accompaniments. The earliest example, Warner Bros Don Juan (1926). was given an orchestral score by two experienced hands, William Axt and David Mendoza of the Capitol Theater in New York, and like their previous scores this one was compilation, intermixed with some original music. What set it apart was that it was recorded (in performance by the New York Philharmonic under Henry Hadley) and the Vitaphone customary live performances that often preceded the presentation ofimportant films, this première included a one hour programme of Vitaphone shorts, plus a brief filmed

speech promising a new era in music and motion pictures' a sub sequent, phenomenally popular Vitaphone feature; The Jazz Singer (1927). Though it was given much thesame kind of accompaniment (skilfully arranged by Louis Silvers, who had prepared scores for some of Griffith's films)  what excited audiences the most were the songs performed by the now immortal 'You ain't heard nothin' yet')

The success of The Jazz Singer pointed the way toward three parallel developments in Hollywood over the next a new genre (the musical), and the rush by other studios to develop their own recording technologies (some using sound recorded on film, which ultimately became the direction film music was taking Or ought to take~was by no means clear. In Europe as well as America, these were of enormous excitement and debate over the advantages and drawbacks of thenew technology; and not everyone rushed to embrace either synchronized sound in general Or canned music in particular. Even as late as 1932, in characteristically succinct, insightful, and perverse essay, Virgil Thomson could dismiss the music that had been composed expressly for sound films, remembering fondly the days of hearing better-known movements from the symphonic repertory' performed live; and asserting that 'the best union of movies and music that has ever been made was still to be found in René Clair's short film Entr'acte (1924) with its scoreby Erik Satie Thomposition may have been unique (and reflected his interest in modern French music) but he had raised question which needed to be addressed by avant-garde and mainstream film-makers alike: what roles and types of music worked best in a medium which had once been purely visual but could now be heard as well as seen? years

## EXPERIMENTAL SOUND-TRACKS

Despite Thomson's assertion, experimental collaborations between avant-garde directors and composers in Europe did not cease with Entr'acte or with the coming of sound. Indeed, Paris itself continued to be a site for their production: it was home for example, to three delightfully unconventional 'musical' comedies by Clair himself (Sous les toits de Paris, 1930; Le Million, 1931; and À nous la liberté, 1931). The last of these was graced by particularly charming score by Georges Auric; whoin 1930 had composed stranger music for Cocteau's exercise in surrealism, Blood of a Poet (this being the only sound film which Thomson acknowledged to contain some fine music'). After Auric the most original film musician to appear in Paris was Maurice Jaubert, who early on comremarkable scores for films of Painlevé, Storck, Clair; key posed

Cavalcanti, and-most notably-for Vigo's Zéro de conduite

In Britain and Germany some of the most impressive collaborations originated in the documentary genre, as in Basil Wright and Walter Leigh's of Ceylon (1934). This film propaganda; and Leigh made use of (inexpensive) chamber ensembles, and anti-Romantic textures and tunes through the imitation of Far Eastern idioms. (Moreover; like Thomson and Jaubert, and Eisler in Germany; Leigh explained spokesman for 'modernist' theories of film music:) Song track, which exemplifies what came to be called 'sound montage' that is, the music overlaps with other auditory a 1680 travelogue, conwas apparently to create musical style based on the dictates of the new technology. 'Every sound in a film;' he wrote, 'must be significant one'and he praised the 'canned' quality of film music as its 'most important characteristic and greatest virtue' . No less important is the sound-track's 'contrapuntal' effect, where what is heard often bears only an indirect correspondence to what is seen Thus was realized one of the goals of avantfilm-making throughout the early sound period: somehow to preserve the silent film's highly developed time impeded by the cumbersome nature of the new technology; and threatened more generally by the impact of popular films offering sound-tracks that were simply literal in nature. Song key garde for

What concerned creative film-makers most was the dominanceof 'talkies'an apt name for early sound films which combined dialogue, naturalistic sound effects; and purely diegetic uses of music. At first these sound-tracks were many oftheearliest examples were very dull (e.g. Warners first '100 per-cent all-talkie' , The Lights of New York, 1928); but, after a few years, developments in camera technology and techniques of   post-synchronization allowed for increased fluidity of both sights and sounds Even so, in the interest of greater realism most of these films broke with tradition and dispensed with continuous accompaniment, thus pointing up a key paradox: only the advent of the sound film enabled the medium to claim moments of silence as part of the narrative. Given this new cinematic universe, film-makers discarded the traditional silent-film score and learnt to rely on ways of making small scraps of music count. One famous example is Fritz Lang's M(1931) use of diegetic music; notably Grieg's 'In the Hall ofthe Mountain King' , which is obsessively whistled by the murderer. The piece had long

## ANIMATED FILMS AND MUSICALS

Two Hollywood genres which did require major con tributions composers and abundant amounts of music were musicals and Disney's animated films; and also gave rise to far-reaching developments in techniques of recording and (post-JsynchronizationCartoons needed virtually continuous music to bring the flat drawto life, and, for the illusion to be sustained, had to be precisely synchronized from start to finish. So, too, did each musical number in feature, and by the mid-1930s the common procedure was to record the number first, and then to film it which enabled the actors to move freely about the set, or dance upon it, while mouthing  the words.  (Post-production cess as necessary ) Thus, pioneers in both genres solved technological problems, while creating many films that display considerable artistry. they using

To Disney is due part of the credit for such small-scale masterpieces as Skeleton Dance (1928) and Three Little Pigs (1933); atleast an equal amount should go to the men who composed their scores, Carl Stalling and Frank Churchill respectively  Both can be seen as prototypes for cartoon the former is parody of silent-film music styles and links five distinct segments into a tightly organized whole; each containing symmetrical patterns suitable for dance; the latter is more loosely organized shape of the film's narrative, but is centred on the simple title song's verse and chorus tunes in a kind of free rondo structure. a more expansive score, the range of parody extends from nineteenth-century melo 'silly symphonies endured as another long-standing tradition of cartoon scores Stalling came up with the 'Silly Symphony' label and was Disney's principal comtive and witty at he was Music Director for cartoons from 1936 to 1958. owing Being have

Hollywood musicals flourished from 1929 on. Although as mixed in musical idioms as cartoons (which often

resembled musicals in miniature) owed their musical essentials to Broadway; which supplied the Hollywood studios with a continual influx of performers , composers, arrangers, and conductors. As in Broadway shows; moreover; most songs in movie musicals followed two basic forms which consisted of an introductory verse and chorus of thirty-two bars in one of two patterns, than Broadway shows: musical numbers on film carried more weight than their stage counterparts, and were often distributed less Broadway Melody (1929), for example contains only two important songs 'Broadway Melody' and 'You Were Meant for Me' by Nacio Herb Brown and Arthur Freed) each representing a theme of the narrative. The first is sung three times, the second only once. (Both, however, are heard at other points as underscoring:) What removed film musicals even further from theirstagecousins was that each number was shaped by camera movement and cutting: as result, the observer's point of view might shift freely; from distant head OI even under-leg shots, as in the fantastic choreography was one of the genre's three greatest founding figures, along with Fred Astaire, and Berlin, whose songs display perfect balance of lyric and musical expression they key Irving

one of the most satisfying examples of the genre ever made. The plot's style is consistent with the film's gentle satire of high-class speech, manners, and dress, and serves as perfect backdrop for five skilfully constructed songs ('No Strings', 'Isn't this Lovely Hat' 'Cheek to Cheek' , and 'The Piccolino'); of these the second and fourth, duets in dance, evoke the film's deepest feeling   (especially the latter, one of Berlin's most unusually structured and passionate numbers , given stunchoreography). the songs are spaced and at least the first four function beautifully to crystallize character and advance plot.

Top Hat succeeds so well because the three men were perfectly matched in their ability to negotiate range of idioms: Berlin bridged jazz and classical styles of melody and harmony, Astaire (cochoreographer with Hermes Pan) moved easily from vaudeville tap to ballet, and Steiner from the pit band to the symphony orchestra.

## STEINER, KORNGOLD, AND OTHERS

By the mid-1930s, music for Hollywood features occupied one of two contrasting positions: in the diegetic foreground (of musicals), or in the nondiegetic background (of all other films) . In the one, the music came first into

Within this system, composers served as subordinates under contract to studio music departments, and faced serious   constraints . For one thing, feature   usually always short-sometimes as little as three weeks-since the major studios turned out from thirty to fifty films year.

Two are Steiner originals: warm hymn-like  melody associated with Victor Laszlo, and slowly descending fragment of a chromatic scale, threatening the lovers with In short, all six   themes use concise melodic material that is easily recognized and ideal for manipulation. By contrast, Korngold's score for Robin Hood contains at least eleven primary themes, all of them original in the main title, the first is jaunty march of sixteen bars enlivened by some very unconventional harmonies and inner-voice counterpoint; the second sounds like the kind ofdistorted folk tune heard in symphonies by Mahler; and the third is long-breathed Romantic melody that spans almost two octaves .

And a much more telling example occurs with the Paris flashback:  the bridge from present to past-from the closeup of Rick in his darkened café listening to Sam 'play it' (again) through a dissolve to shot of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, then to one of Rick and Ilse together in the French countryside-the sequence being accompanied by fluid series of transof the Marseillaise when the arch view.

Moreover; because he was a special brought the studio prestige-he was required to compose no more than two scores a year. He worked at each score for many months, sitting at the piano and playing segments repeatedly while he watched the film over and over; and the results could be dazzling in their harmonic richness and contrapuntal splendour; as in his music for the scenes of the archery tournament and coronation procession in Robín Hood. These are the score's great set pieces (coming amid others almost as worthy; including the dance music that emulates old English styles for the scene of the banquet at Nottingham castle). If are surpassed, it is only by the score's ending; which offers a gorgeous series and transformations of Robin Hood's theme (in its third noblest version), culminating in truly Romantic apotheosis, whereby melody andharmony come together to suggest both trumpet fanfares and the glorious pealing of wedding bells. Robin Hood is as entertaining fantasy as Hollywood knew how to make, and no other music could do more to enhance the pleasure it provides.

Making = a virtue of necessity; Steiner withholds the song his score until after Ilse enters the café and asks Sam to it, 'for old time's sake'\_ But almost immediately after it is introduced Steiner begins to use it frequently in a number of 'contrasting variations These culminate in passionate waltz, when the lovers say goodbye ('We'll always have Paris looking at kid' ) capped by a grandly tragic cadence. Yet thecadence does not hold , but melts instead into the next culminating segment of the score, based on other themes, most notably the Marseillaise' the this song, in variations ethereal and triumphant, provides the film with satisfying conclusion-and; as such, it precludes our worrying about the details of the plot, or the implausibly resolution . (It us back out of the film's world just as efficiently as the main title brought us in.) beginning to end, Steiner's method is to subordinate his music to aspects of the narrative, catching as many cinematic details as he can often at the expense of coherent form. Indeed, at times his music follows a film's action so literally (in the manner of a score for a cartoon) that the style has been described with the derogatory term 'Mickey-Mousing' . All the same, Steiner's scores often move us deeply; just as the writers of Casablanca understood that we can be overwhelmed by nostalgia when we hear certain songs from our past (no matter whether are actually any good), so Steiner knew that very simple themes, skilfully connected and repeated in deft transformations, could work both intellectually and subliminally on an audience; and make the melodramatic convincing. from sing you, fog quick brings key they

## NEW TENDENCIES TO 1960

Even in the early 1940s, however, some composers were undermining the established form of Hollywood scoring. In lucid essay published in 1941, Aaron Copland questioned the need for film composers to be restricted to nineteenth-century symphonic style. sympathetic outsider; Copland   visited Hollywood periodically and produced important scores for four major independent films: Of Mice and Men (1939), Our Town (1940), The Red Pony (1948), and The Heiress (1949). In leitmotifs. Yet this did not seem to diminish his influence in Or out of Hollywood; in fact in 1949 he was awarded both a Pulitzer Prize for his Red Pony Suite, and an Academy Award for his score for The Heiress.

Copland's case is roughly parallel to that of three other composers active during the same period: Virgil Thomson William Walton. Like Copland, each of them had underrigorous classical training that led to careers marily as concert composers; and each developed an idiosyncratic style that was considered conservative for nationalistic for its use of native tunes, and modernistic in terms of harmony; orchestration, and emotional tone\_ As for their film scores, each is best known for a handful written in prigone

## INNOVATION INSIDE AND OUTSIDE HOLLYWOOD

In the 1940s and 1950s, many other influential directors outside Hollywood likewise sought to transcend the clichés of 'movie music' in a number of ways. Perhaps the most radical was to dispense with it as much as possible; absence of music contributes to the general desolation\_ Another was to use very simple music for soloist(s) an effective means of money and either suggesting a of the films best known for this approach are The Third Man (1949), scored entirely with zither solos by Anton Karas , with haunting music by Narciso Yepes. Some directors took an alternative route to the same destination by introducing quotations from Lang's method in M): though this practice became more common one including such divergent films as Brief Encounter (1945) and Un condamné à mort s'est échappé (A Man Escaped, 1956), which feature Rachmaninov's Second Piano Concerto and Mozart 's Mass in € Minor respectively. Still, most directors continued to depend on living composers for large amounts of music. If these scores seem to differ in style or function from the norms ofHollywood, the reason is that the film auteurs had direct control of their work, trust in their composers (often sustained through collaborations of standing) an appreciation for new musical styles. Examples abound in the films of Powell and other directors of comedies) Fellini, Wajda, and Mizoguchi: all made great films during these decades, and all deserve attention for their sensitivity to the of music as a crucial component of innovative cinema\_ saving guitar long and Ealing power

and Sturges, among others: directors of great films within Hollywood in the 1940s, favoured composers who were willing to take risks and scores that challenged pre Welles brought Bernard Herrmann from New York to RKO to score Citizen Kane (1941), as part of his Mercury Theatre team; and like his score abounds in brilliant ideas, especially impressive from someone scoring a film for the first time Another brilliant first occurred when Preminger gave David Raksin; until then mainly a staff arranger at Fox, the opportunity to write the score for Laura (1944) Wilder they

and Hitchcock, with Selznick their producer, brought Miklós Rózsa (1945), thus launching him on a new career as a master of contemporary psychological drama and film noir. Wyler tooka chance on Friedhofer; at that time employed mostly as an orchestrator; and, as a result, The Best Years of our Lives (1946) was given one of Hollywood's most perfect scores, very much in the Copland manner. Finally, Sturges-this time with Newman himself as both conductor and comwhich Rossini, Wagner; and Tchaikovsky are parodied with great wit\_ Moreover, the comedy and subtly makes a point about the purposes of 'movie music' Blurring distinctions between the diegesis and the external, the film demonstrates, in its presentation of dreams 'conducted" by music, that the latter has the power to control our imagination and to make even the most outlandish fantasy seem real.

The power of fantasy, and selfreflexiveness, also contribute to the substance and style of Wilder's Sunset Boulevard (1950), film which signals the growing appeal of modernism in the 195Os, with important consequences for music Most of Waxman's score for Sunset Boulevard is wonderfully subtle. Particularly effective is the music which accompanies the scene nearthe end when Joe Gillis attempts to walkout on Norma Desmondandis murdered\_ Waxman composed a repeat of music from the main title Fate Theme" (his own label). But, unlike the strident original, here the music is barely audible and proceeds in 'slow motion' throughout, the effect being unsettling, seeming to suggest that Joe is trapped in dream without knowing it. For the film's climaxes-especially at the end, as Norma descends into madness-Waxman shifts to deliberately intrusive music with exaggerated power, first with a deliberate parody of Strauss's Salomé, finally with shockingly abrupt close in surprise major key. This is music in the expressionist style, which had its roots in film noir scores of the 1940s and which thereafter flourished in numerous dark Amer ican 'problem films

By 1950, even in Hollywood, the traditional Romantic developments such as the breakup of the studio theatre chains, the steady growth of independent productions, the introduction ofwidescreen processes, and the parallel adoption of stereophonic sound and magnetic tracks did much to broaden the range of available styles. New styles idioms, 'authentic" modal styles for biblical epics, and folklike ballads for Westerns.

The transition to sound at the end of the 1920s initiated a transformation in basic motion picture technology that extended beyond the unique innovation of sound itself. The sound revolution set in motion a series ofother experiments in the area of motion picture presentation. These experiments would ultimately lead to a second major technological revolution in to the introduction of widescreen movies , filmed in colour and recorded in stereophonic, magnetic sound. Of course, colour had been in more or less continuous use for filming spectacles throughout the 1930s and 1940s. However, the number of colour films made during this period remained quite small, and it was not until the 1950s that colour was extensively used by the entire film industry.

Indeed, what remains so fascinating about this 'second technological revolution is how it took to Given that its origins lay in the late 1920s, why was its full The transition to sound took place in less than four years , but the shift to widescreen and colour; as new standards for production and exhibition, did not occur for over twenty years.

## THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD

Since their inception in the 1890s, motion pictures have routinely been part of a larger entertainment programme which featured other attractions, such as live stage shows In the late 1910s and 1920s, movie palaces included live prologues, comedy acts, dancers , and singers. Films were formed separately in individually billed concerts Early sound films, especially Warner Bros. Vitaphone shorts\_

Movietone newsreels, which headlined topical events or well-known personalities; served to duplicate the attractions featured by vaudeville theatres and movie palaces for playback in the average neighbourhood theatre.

mode of presentation introducing sound segments 'acts'intootherwise silent narratives. The Jazz Singer (1927), for example; intersperses short synchronous dialogue and song sequences with stretches of musically underscored, melodramatic action that is essentially 'silent' . Much of the thrill of these early films came the sudden and dramatic switch from silence to sound. Even today; these shifts to sound function as a kind ofspectacle to silence behave as anticlimactic interruptions of the spectacle\_ Jong from

This concept of spectacle in presentation informs the experimentation that takes place with new technologies other than sound. Widescreen and large-screen projection of the period regularly drew upon sensational alterations in image size Thus Abel Gance's Napoléon (1927), which was partially filmed in Polyvision; expands at climactic moments of the narrative from one-screen to three-screen of the projected image. Gance filmed certain sequences with three interlocked 35 recorded panoramic view on three separate strips of film. In other sequences, Gance juxtaposed the central

## COLOUR

By the same token, early experiments in matography resulted in the production of both colour sequences in black and white features, and colour shorts , reinforcing the notion of the new technology as a novelty. Between 1926 and 1932, over thirty films were made which included one or more colour sequences. The majority of these sequences were musical numbers, such as those in The Broadway Melody (1929), The Desert (1929), and of Jazz (1930); fashion shows , as in Irene (1926); ceremonial Song King

displays, such as the military procession in The Wedding March (1928); and action sequences , such as aerial combat footage in Hell's Angels (1930).

Filming was accomplished with special camera, containing = beam-splitting prism behind the lens. The beamstrips of film held together (emulsion to emulsion) in a biThe front film of the bi-pack recorded blue information; the back film recorded red. The remainder of the light passed directly through the lens to a green-sensitive negative at the rear of the camera In this way, each negative recorded the black and white record of different colour and could be used, together with the other two; to reconstruct the original colour of the scene that had been pack.

Walt Disney enjoyed the exclusive rights to make animated films in Technicolor 1932 to 1935, producing Academy Award winning shorts such as Flowers and Trees (1932) and The Three Little Pigs (1933). In 1933 Pioneer Productions , which owned stock in Technicolor; began to live-action, three-colour film which won an Academy Award for Best Comedy Short Subject. from

By the mid-1930s, colour as novelty had given way somewhat to more normative patterns of colour usage. Black and white films no longer featured colour sequences, though occasional transitions from black and function as majority of colour films tended to be animated films (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 1938), musicals (The Goldwyn Pine, 1936) and costume pictures andJor epics (Becky Sharp, 1935; The Adventures of Robin Hood, 1938; Gone with the Wind\_ 1939)

By 1929 a similar attempt to provide a more uniform usage of widescreen had also been introduced in the form of various wide film processes , such as Grandeur, Realife Natural Vision. Magnascope merely enlarged standard 35 mm. film, making the granular structure of the image increasingly visible. However; these other widescreen processes relied on wide film ranging from 56 mm: (Magnafilm) to 65 mm. (Grandeur) which provided a better image when projected on a large quickly disappeared, largely because it involved tremencosts on the part of exhibitors, who would be required to install new projectors and screens, and because its use was restricted to a small number of urban movie palaces which could accommodate it without an extensive and costly redesign of their theatres.

The appearance of colour and widescreen during the :ansition-to-sound period stems not only from that era's terest in novel forms of presentation in the theatre but 'om technological considerations as well. Prior to sound\_ olour was frequently achieved on the screen by tinting nd toning motion pictures.

Technicolor's two- and three-colour processes solved this problem, relying on a printing process that preserved the integrity of the original black and white sound-track information. Technicolor used separate black and white negatives-one for colour record-to produce matrices, Or relief images similar to printing blocks or rubber stamps. Each of these matrices was dipped in different colour dye and was then used to transfer this dye on to This process was known as 'imbibition because the blank film stock 'drank up' the colour dyes; it was also referred to as the 'dye transfer' process each

Gregg Toland was a wonder' . Born on 24 May 1904 in Charleston, Illinois, Toland broke into films at age 15 as an office and within a year was working as an asmatographer George Barnes, who served as his mentor cameraman' in Hollywood.

Toland further refined his distinctive photographic stylein two films John Ford, The Grapes of Wrath (1940) and The Long Voyage Home (1940), but it is on Citizen Kane (1941) that the Toland style is most pronounced, most systematically and effectively   employed, and most satisfactorily tocombine his technical interests within a single picture. He saw Citizen asa chance to experiment on a large scale. In a June 1941 article in Popular Photography entitled 'How [ Broke the Rules on Kane' Toland related that 'the photographic approach was planned and considered was itself 'most unconventional in Hollywood' where cinematographers generally have only a few days to prepare to shoot depth study of the production, writes that Welles and Toland 'approached the flm together in spirit of revolutionary fervor' and that 'Welles not only for Kane

Novel notions of the moviegoing   experience as 'montage of attractions explain, in part, the experimentation with 3-D systems in the 1920s and 1930s. The as MGM's Audioscopiks (1938), all relied on anaglyphic righteye and were photographed through filters of different colours and then projected in the theatre through those same filters. The filters coded the two different views and spectators wore eye glasses fitted with the same two filters which decoded them, restoring right-eye and left-eye views of the original scene

## THE ZOOM LENS

Sensationalism also governed the usage of the first zoom lenses, which appeared in the transition-to-sound period zoom OI vari-focal lens possesses   the ability to move through a variety of different focal lengths from the widement produces an enlargement or diminution of the contents of the image similar to that achieved by the physical any actual movement of the camera itself: as those accomplished with the was introduced by the British optical firm Taylor & Hobson in 1932, tend to exploit the technology; rapidly zooming in or out in such way as to call attention to the sudden transformation of the size of objects within the frame. Thus in American Madness (1932) the camera quickly zooms in on a clock as it is struck by bullet; and in Thunder Below (1932) a zoom simulates the point of view (and rapid rate of descent) of a woman as she falls from a cliff to the rocks below.

A modern zoom lens was introduced in the post-war era. In the early zoom lenses, the various optical elements were moved in relation to one another mechanically by Frank Back marketed the Zoomar lens for 16 mm. cameras Unlike the earlier zooms \_ the Zoomar had no cams OI cranks; it was entirely optical in design.And unlike earlier lenses , which necessitated change in the lens aperture each time there was a change in focal length, the aperture of the Zoomar, which was placed behind all the movable elements of the lens, required no change during shots, thus simplifying the operation of the lens. The Zoomar found immediate use in the television industry and in newsreels where it facilitated the coverage of sporting events. It was not employed extensively in the film industry until the 1960s, when zoom lenses produced in the late

variety of developments in related fields of film technology

With the exception of colour; all of these transitionto-sound technologies disappeared in the 1930s-largely because there was no demand for them from audiences , who had abandoned for novel spectacularizations of the film medium, in favour of the film message. Fascination with form gave way to concern for movie-going had become more or less habitual; audiences came to theatres on regular basis to see their favourite performers in new story situations; it was no longer necessary to lure spectators into the theatres with new forms of motion picture exhibition.

## DEEP FOCUS

The chief technological innovation during the 1930s was the development of focus cinematography. Deep focus involved the expansion of depth of field, resulting inimages that maintained sharp focus from objects in the extreme foreground to those in the distant background. Deep focus was achieved by filming with extremely wide angled lenses whose apertures had been stopped down. This sort of cinematography was made possible by deep

Filming in the Technicolor process required greater illumination than did black and white cinematography, leading to the creation of a new, more powerful carbon arc lamp; which was subsequently adopted for filming in black and white. These new lights permitted cameramen to decrease the aperture of existing wide-angle lenses and thus obtain a sharp, focus image. deep

At the same time, improvements in the of black and white film stock made it possible to secure adequate exposure with a smaller lens aperture In competition with German manufacturers , such as Agfa-Ansco, Eastman Kodak increased the speed of its standard, fine grain, panchromatic Eastman negative from an ASA of 20 (DIN 14) in 1928 to 40 (DIN 17) for Eastman's Super X negative stock in 1935, then to 80 ASA (DIN 20) and 160 ASA (DIN 23) in 1938 for Plus-X and Super XX respectively grain comparable to Super X and speed that was four times as speed great.

In 1939 the introduction of lens coatings, which permitted 75 per cent more light to pass through the lens to the film inside the camera, enabled cinematographers to decrease the lens aperture an additional facilitating

greater image definition. The advent of the Mitchell BNC camera, which was introduced in 1934 but which was not produced in any numbers until 1939, also played a role\_ This camera dispensed with cumbersome external blimps it thus eliminated the external blimp's glass plate through which the film was shot, further increasing the transmission oflight by as much as 10per cent.

As with these other technologies; deep focus traces its origins back to earlier periods . Lumière's actualities of the These and other films which were shot in exteriors took advantage of relatively short focal-length lenses and abundant sunlight to produce 'deep' images. Jean-Louis Comolli (1980) has connected the demise of early focus with the introduction of panchromatic film stock in 1925, which brought with it a different code of photographic realism According to this new code, the film stock's greater sensitivity to the full range of colours signified greater realism; while its relative shallow depth of field and softer contemporary it introduced lack (of a sense of relief) which supposedly prompted the quest for deep focus in the late 1930s. If the logic of Comolli's argument holds, then deep focus is also an indirect product of technological changes introduced in the transition-to-sound deep period.

## THE 1950s: WIDESCREEN AND STEREO

The creation of habitual moviegoing audience in the effectively terminated technological experimentation There was little Or no demand on the part of audiences for technological innovation and costconscious exhibitors saw no reason to invest in the new projection equipment which 3-D, widescreen, and other exhibition technologies would   require. the prompted a search for novel forms of presentation and led to the reintroduction of these earlier technologies.

tures in the United States stood at 90 million--an all-time result of the demographic shift of a large percentage of the US population from the cities; where the major movie theatres were located to the suburbs. At the same time, the return to forty-hour work week, the institution of one- and two-week paid

posable personal income resulted in the creation of new patterns in leisure-time entertainment. Consumers abandoned passive entertainment, such as film-going, in favour of active participation in forms of recreation such as gardactivities filled greater and greater blocks of the leisure time available to post-war audiences, while television satisfied their need for short-term; passive entertainment.

The American motion picture industry responded to these new 'patterns by providing more participatory forms of entertainment, which were modelled, in part, on concepts of presence associated with the legitimate theatre New motion picture technologies involved spectators with the on-screen action in ways which provided them with an enhanced illusion of participation Cinerama, introduced in September  1952, informed its audiences that 'you won't be gazing at a movie screen-you'll find yourself swept right into the picture, surrounded by sight and sound' . Thus

Advertisements for Bwana Devil (1952), which was filmed in 3-D, addressed audiences in thrilling them with the promise of 'a lion in your lap' and 'a lover in your Ads CinemaScope, which was introduced with the première of The Robe in September 1953, told potential spectators that CinemaScope 'puts You in the picture' And ads for Todd-AO's Oklahoma!

Cinerama, which was developed outside the film industry by Long Island inventor, Fred Waller; achieved its remarkable senseofparticipation by filling the spectator's field of peripheral vision; encompassing an angle of view that was 146 degrees wide and 55 degrees tall This was accomplished by filming with three interlocked 35 mm. cameras , which were equipped with wideangle; 27 mm lenses set at angles of 48 degrees to one another: The Cinerama camera ran atan accelerated of 26 frames per second to reduce flicker and exposed 35 mm. negative that was six perforations high rather than the standard four.

Mag

This Is   Cinerama (1952), the first Cinerama feature, grossed handful of theatres; due to the complex requirements of the format's projection system. The first five Cinerama films were all travelogues, and it was not until 1962 that the format was used to film narrative features, such as How the West Was Won. Three-strip Cinerama lasted until 1963, when it was replaced by Ultra Panavision, a 70 mm process which used slight anamorphic compression to squeeze Cinerama's wide angle of view on to single strip of film, thus duplicating Cinerama's original 2.77 : 1 aspect ratio (the term aspect ratio' refers to the relation of a projected image's width to its height)

The success of 3-D was even more short-lived than Cinerama, lasting for only about eighteen months, from late 1952 to the spring of 1954. In the 1950s 3-D relied upon polaroid filters rather than the anaglyphic format. An it became associated with exploitation genres; such as the horror film (House of Wax, 1953; Creature from the Black Lagoon, 1954), science-fiction films (It Came from Outer Space

CinemaScope, which was introduced by 2Oth Century Fox, attempted to duplicate Cinerama; streamlining it for of the CinemaScope system was an anamorphic  lens, which had been developed back in 1927 by a French scientist, Henri Chrétien. This lens compressed a wide angle of view on to 35 mm. film; a similar anamorphic lens on the projector in the theatre decompressed the image, prO ducing, on slightly curved, highly reflective screen, panoramic view that had an aspect ratio (subsequently reduced to the current standard of 2.35 when an optical sound-track was added to it in 1954). Unlike Cinerama, which required a separate strip of film to hold the tracks for its stereo magnetic sound, CinemaScope used magnetic oxide striping to place four tracks thus eliminating the need for additional personnel in the theatre

Fox engineers crammed all this information on to single strip of 35 mm. film by redesigning the frame area as well as reducing the size of the perforations along both sides of the film. In this, Fox took advantage of the increased durability and stability of safety-based acetate doing

film stock, which had been introduced in 1949 to replace the highly flammable nitrate film stock, which tended to shrink during processing.

CinemaScope quickly became an industry standard; by the end of 1954, every studio except for Paramount, which had developed its own widescreen   process known as by 1957 85 per cent of all US and Canadian theatres had been equipped to show CinemaScope films. In Europe, the Soviet Union, and Japan, a number of CinemaScope clones emerged, including Dyaliscope and Franscope (France) 1958 Panavision developed high-quality anamorphic lens, which it effectively marketed to the rest of the industry. And by 1967 Fox had retired CinemaScope in favour of Panavision duction.

CinemaScope also made use of the new Eastman Color Technicolor three-strip camera was unable to accommodate a CinemaScope lens so Fox switched to single-strip Eastman Color negative, conducted by the German company Agfa in 1939, which was Eastman's film featured three layers of emulsion, each sensitive to a different primary colour. During processing, dyes held within the film were released in response to the reproducing the original colour. The advent of Eastman Color broke the grip which Technicolorhad on production in colour; stimulating a dramatic increase in the number of films made in colour. In 1945, only Hollywood films were shot in colour; by 1955, that percentage had climbed to over 50.

Not all film-makers, however; were happy with the new widescreen format. Sidney Lumet noted that 'the essence Hollywood finds a way of photographing people directly opposite to the way people are built. CinemaScope makes no sense until people are fatter than are taller. Fritz Lang joked (in lines which he later repeated in Jean-Luc of Contempt (Le Mépris, 1963)) that CinemaScope was a format ideally suited for filming snakes and funerals, but not human But by the end of the decade, widescreen had become a new standard\_ a new generation of artists-to directors such as Nicholas and Otto Pre and to cinematographers such as Joseph LaShelle and Sam Leavitt. they beings.

The technical advances   explored in the Silly   Symphonies partly arose from rivalry with the Fleischers , who, among all the other animation studios that survived into the sound era, consistently produced excellent cartoons in the early 1930s. Unlike the Disney product, which tation the earlier Fleischer cartoons   revelled in stylcal developments which seem inherent, distinctive properties or potentials of animation Disney's Koko whose surrealistic escapades allow him to intervene in the creative process of escape in Koko the Convict (1926), to Manhattan in bury

Dave Fleischer invented the rotoscope process, which he used to allow overtly cartoon figures to mime, uncannily human actions; Disney used the rotoscope to create realistic-looking human figures. When in 1934 the Fleischers introduced the stereoptical process which gave a sense of realistic depth by three dimensional models behind the cel-animated characters, Disney countered by promoting his multiplane camera which produced similar depth sensations through   coordinating several   layers of moving cels (independent animators such as Lotte Reiniger and Berthold Bartosch had been that since the early 1920s) using doing

The cave walls, less subtle than Minnie's, also illustrate phrases, depicting a table of gamdrugs and drink. Later that year Bernie Wolf and Tom Johnson animated yet another Cab Calloway film, Old Man of the Mountain, one of the worst etons decorate the cave walls, while tasteless, flimsy story shows Betty leaving countless illegitimate babies in his wake\_ Boop

In Mysterious Mose (1930), Willard Bowsky and Ted Sears created a hit starring the new sexy Betty Boop (still with dog ears) falling in love with seemingly magical Bimbo, who dances to Cab Calloway music but turns out to be an automaton; Bimbo's mysterious charm stems partly from his continuous transformations, which follow a narrative logic, as when heart shoots out to steal' Betty's. Bowsky then teamed up with Ralph Sommerville of the great animation films; Betty runs away from home because of her authoritarian parents, but encounters in a cave where she hides a 'spook who brings the title song alive with images that demonstrate the evil wiles of the city and the ungrateful behaviour of children: when kittens suck bottle, which nals re enact ofcrime; walking through prison bars, enjoying electrocution, and scoffing at the authorities as from Cab Calloway's live-action performance that we see at the beginning of the film, which emphasizes the cartoon qualities ofthe spook, as do the fine surreal watercolour backgrounds which subtly allow grasping skeleton hands to emerge from the cave walls . for they cycles

The Fleischer genius lay not merely in technology; however; but also in their ability to connect the surprising fantastic with meaningful metaphor that, as in classic fables, exposed an inner truth of human life\_ While Disney's Flowers and Trees irrelevantly superimposes a clichéd melodrama about dirty old man versus young lovers (who eventually triumph in marriage) over images of plants, Shamus Culhane in the Fleischers" 1931 Cows Husband cleverly uses the relationship between human and animal behaviour to debunk the myth of brave bullfighting, culminating in an elegant ballet for the bull.

While a great deal of nostalgia surrounds this period as 'golden age" of animation--and indeed the demand for new cartoons every week at thousands of cinemas tained ten animation studios in the USA-the numerical majority of cartoons remained mediocre. Terrytoons continued their silentera record to produce hundreds of unmemorable cartoons until 1968, perhaps peaking with Mighty Mouse and Heckle and Jeckle in the 1940s and Walter Lantz continued to produce Disney's silentPanda and the annoying Woody Woodpecker (modelled after the early zany Daffy Duck) appeared in 1940 and Chilly Willy in the 1950s, but though Lantz continued to produce cartoons until 1972, the level of inspiration, the Fleischers, and Warners\_ Van Beuren also flogged its continued lacklustre Krazy Kat until 1939-

## DISNEY AND THE ANIMATED FEATURE

Walt Disney began work on feature-length animation film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, in 1934, during his height of success with Mickey Mouse and the Silly Symphonies. Before the feature was finished in December 1937 (barely in time for Los Angeles Christmas   preview) Disney employed more than 300 designers, background artists, and effects animators. This meant educating many young artists into animation, as well as away the best talents from other studios, s0 and Grim Natwick (who had designed Betty Boop) came from Fleischers. Inspirational sketches by European artists Gustaf Tenggren and Albert Hurter were transformed into lush, charming, and occasionally frightening film by teams which included loner artists like Art Babbitt, John Hubley; and Bill Tytla (all of whom left Disney in the 1941 strike) as well as tight core of artists who continued to create most subsequent Disney films: Jim Algar, Ken Anderson, Les Clark, Claude Coats, Bill Cottrell, Joe Grant, Wilfred Jackson, Ollie Johnston Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, Ham Luske, Fred Moore, Woolie Reitherman, and Frank Thomas. hiring

Although not the first animated feature (Edera lists eight earlier; including Reiniger's 1926 Prince Ahmed , Starewitch's 1930 The Tale of the and Alexander Ptushko's 1935 The Gulliver) , Snow White enjoyed phenomenal success (including special Oscar) with serious impact on industrial animation. Talent was drained from cartoon to feature production everywhere: Paramount insisted the Fleischers begin and encouraged their move from New York to the cheaper Miami, where made two features , Gulliver's Travels (1939) and Mr; Bug Goes to Town (1941). Gulliver, though an obvious imitation of Snow White without all its charm, scored New they

though artistically superior (in the spirit of Fleischer as the USA entered the Second World War) and flopped. Fleischers had continued to make some shorts, including dozen Stone cartoons (predecessor to the 1960s" Flintstones)  but enjoyed success only with the nineteen Superman cartoons made from 1941 until the studio closed in 1944 they

Disney continued to produce about one animation feature per year into the 1950s, when production slowed. This meant that teams worked on two or three projects at the same time. Disney began preliminary work on Bambi, Fantasia in 1937; in February 1940 Fantasia in December 1940, and Bambi (delayed by the war, the strike, and work on the October 1941 Dumbo) not until August 1942. Disney's lavish animation reached its   pinnacle in Pinocchio's   story-book realism and the extravagant classical-music illustration ofFantasia. Changing finances due to the war and the 1941 strike required that animation be more economical. Plans for second Fantasia" were modified into two popularmusic-based anthology features Make Mine Music (1946) and Melody Time (1948). which allowed simpler graphics, partly suggested by inspirational sketches of Blair who favoured a bold in the 1943 Saludos amigos. Disney features like The Three Caballeros (1945) and Fun and Fancy Free (1947) began to include more live action sequences, and live-action predominated in of the South (1946) and So Dear to my Heart (1949), leading to Disney's all live-action features, beginning with Treasure Island (1950). But Disney also continued full animation features on a looser schedule: Ichabod and Mr Toad (1949), Cinderella (1950), Alice in Wonderland (1951), Peter Pan (1955), and Sleeping Beauty (1959). Mary Song Tramp

Unionization and strikes hit animation studios in the late 1930s, with protests against hours, low salaries , and the lack of health Or pension benefits: the 'golden age" of industrial cartoons was built largely on exploitation of animation artists and craftsmen. The strike the Fleischers in 1937 lasted six months, and depressed Max Fleischer; who regarded himself as a decent employer and thought of the Fleischer studio as a happy family; family feeling disappeared, and the studio would closehalf adozen years later; Walt Disney was similarly depressed by the 1941 strike at his studio, and to a certain degree lost interest in animation because ofit, turning his attention to documentaries and the idea for Disneyland. The Terrytoons strike in 1941 lasted nine months. As the Second World and strikes withdrew many talents from the cartoon slowed duction; and encouraged short cuts (including repetition of gags, less complex movements, and simpler designs) most studios experienced gradual decline in quality: long against War

From Robin Hoodlum in 1948 to Jaywalker in 1956 (both nominated creation of an astonishing series of cartoons with modern art styling, non-violent iterary scripts, and musical scores by contemporary composers. Bobe Cannon's particularly significant contribution involved designing special move ments to express character or ideas, rather than trying to make every motion realistic. Cannon directed UPA's first Oscar-winner, Gerald McBoing (1950), a Dr Seuss story; with design and colour by Hurtz and Engel, animation by Bill Melendez and Cannon, and music by Gail for the Oscar: Madeline and the Rooty Toot Toot; which satirizes the American justice system through the old 'Frankie and Johnny' ballad. Further UPA triumphs in 1953 included Hurtz's adaptation of James Thurber's Unicorn in the Garden and the Ted Parmelee-Paul Julian adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's The Tell-Tale Heart, which rendered the classic hOrror story in surrealist graphics, opening theatrical cartoons to serious subject-matter. paid Boing using stylish

After three more abstract Opus films, Ruttmann would enjoy great success with his 1927 poetic documentary Berlin: Symphony of a City (with special score by Edmund Meisel) and continued in liveaction film, but his friend Oskar Fischinger, who also began abstract animation in the early 1920s, continued to make 'colour music' films into the 1950s. Fischinger's early 'silent' films used live music, including a spectacular abstract multiple originally accompanied by the piano music of Alexander performed with a percussion ensemble. In addition to his abstract films, Fischinger also made some representational cartoons to help finance other work, and created a startling masterpiece of experimental animation in Seelische Konstruktionen ('Spiritual constructions' , 1927), which shows in fluid silhouette metamorphoses the hallucinations of two drunken men who fight in bar and stagger home. When the vogue for sound films swept Germany in 1929, Fischinger convinced tracks in exchange for an end title advertising the disc's the MTV video clip. The series of Studies were immensely internationally, and received prizes at film festivals; Fischinger had completed fourteen of them when the Nazis seized power in 1933,and severalmore remained unfinished since no censorship permit could be obtained for 'degenerate abstract film. He got permit for his first colour film, Kreise ('Circles' 1933), by selling it as publicity film to the Tolirag advertising agency who inserted an end title; 'Tolirag reaches all circles of society' . Fischinger also scored huge success with Muratti greift ein (Muratti gets in the act' , 1934) that capitalized on Olympics fever by showing cigarettes parading into an arena and performing sports like ice skating. With the profits from these ad films, he worked secretly on another colour abstract Composition in Blue (Komposition which brightly coloured cubes and cylinders glide around mirrored spaces He screened Composition in Blue without proper permits, and though it received rave reviews, the Nazi government was Hollywood, where he began work on an episode for The Big Broadcast of 1937.

When Goebbels could no longer afford to import Disney films into Germany; he ordered all studios capable of producing animation to begin making cartoons to fill cinema programmes in Germany and its conquered territories. Hans   Fischerkoesen had begun making animated advertising films in 1921, and devoted himself solely to this genre, creating more than 1,000 before the outbreak of the Second World War. On Goebbels's orders, he turned his small staff to make three cartoons, Weather-Beaten Melody (Verwitterte Melodie, 1942), The Snowman (Der Schneemann, 1943), and The Silly  Goose (Das dumme Gänslein, 1944). Fischerkoesen was an anti-Nazi pacifist; and he managed to charge all three films with subversive message, which, because of the films' technical brilliance, could not be suppressed.

## GENRE BEFORE FILM

Borrowed from the French word meaning 'kind Or 'type (and derived from the Latin word genus), the notion of genre has played an important role in the categorization and evaluation of literature, especially since the Italian French Aristotelian revival of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries In literary studies, the term genre' is used in a variety of ways, to refer to distinctions of different orders between categories of text: type of presentation (epicllyricldramatic) relation to reality (fictionnontragedy) , nature of content (sentimental novellhistorical novelladventure novel) , and so forth-

In an attempt to lend order to this confusing situation; nineteenth-century positivism spawned scientistic attempts to model the study of literary genres first on Linnaeus' binomial classification of animals and plants indicating genus and species) followed by even more insistent schemes to base the study of genre history on Darwinian notions of the evolution of genus and species . Culminating around the turn of the century; at the very time when cinema was being transformed a newfangled curiosity into lucrative world-wide industry these appeals to scientific models failed to lend precision to the notion of 'genre even though generic designators continued to be widely used as broad categories for the sorting and classification of numbers of texts . large

## EARLY FILM GENRE

During the earliest years of film production, individual films were most often identified by length and topic, with genre terms applied to films in only the loosest of fashions When around 1910 film production finally outstripped demand, genre terms were used increasingly to identify and differentiate films . Whereas   literary genre was primarily response to theoretical questions or to practical large-scale classification needs (such as   library organization) early film genre  terminology served as shorthand communication between film distributors and exhibitors.

The earliest film genre terminology was commonly bor-

## GENRE FILM IN THE STUDIO PERIOD

In dealing with genre terminology it is important to distinguish among the different functions that the notion of genre may play for the various participants in the cinema process. Three roles in particular must be recognized:

- 1. Production: the generic concept provides a template for production decisions. As a form of tacit knowit presents privileged mode of communication among members of the production team. ledge,
- 2. Distribution: the generic concept offers fundamental method of product differentiation, thus constituting shorthand mode communication distributor or tributor and exhibitor.
- 3. Consumption: the generic concept describes standard patterns of spectator involvement. As such, it facilitates communication between theexhibitor and

By definition, all films belong to some genre(s) at least in terms of distribution categories, but only certain films are selfconsciously produced and consumed according to (or against) When the notion of genre is limited to descriptive uses, as it commonly is when serving distribution or classification purposes; we speak of 'film genre' . However; when the notion of genre takes on more active role in the production and consumption processes , we appropriately speak instead of genre film'  thus recognizing the extent to which generic identifcation becomes formative component of film viewing.

Growth in genre film production is usually accompanied by shift from content-based notions of genre to genre definitions based on repeated plot motifs , narrative figurations and predictable reception conventions. In the United States, the first films that we now think of as Westerns were in fact not s0 conceived by contemporary audiences. The Great Train Robbery (1903), for example, was assimilated to the many other stage melodramas adapted by early film-makers; instead of immediately serving as a model for future Westerns, it first inspired a spateofcrime decade, however, a growing production 'western romances' , and solidified into genre called the many possible associations of the adjective clearly suggest, the Western could take on any of a multitude of different plots, characters, or tones. During the 1910s and 1920s, however; the possibilities implied by a simple geographical designator (along with diverse influences from growing western iconography and literature) were explored , sifted, and codifed. Once only geographical adjective   designating for films of various types Western quickly became the name for loosely defined distribution oriented film genre capi-

talizing on interest in the West. Later strengthened and conventionalized   generic concept would inspire the   repeated production of genre films syStematically interpreted by spectators according to standards particular to the 'Western' . public

In a similar manner; it is commonly alleged that the musical burst on to the Hollywood scene with the coming of sound. In fact, the first films built around entertainers and their music were not identified as 'musicals' . Instead\_ the presence of music was at first treated simply as manner of presenting narrative material that already had its own generic affinities. During the early years of sound in Hollywood , we thus find the term 'musical' always used as an adjective; modifying such diverse nouns as comedy, romance, melodrama, entertainment, attraction, dialogue, and revue. Even films currently considered as classics of the early musical were not labelled as musicals when first appeared. In 1929 The Broadway Melody was described in MGM publicity as an all talking, all singing, all dancing dramatic sensation while Warners characterized The Desert as an 'all talking, all singing operetta Not until the end of the year was the term Radio Pictures' Rio Rita as a 'screen musical' . they Song

Ironically; the use of 'musical" as free-standing term designa genre did not achieve general acceptance until the 1930-1 season, when the public's taste for musicals took a nosedive. Only retrospectively; in reference to the production of the preceding years, could films of such differing natures appear to constitute of category that we call film genre, musical films in this early period had not yet become genre flms as such, for the conventions characteristic of genre flm production and consumption had not yet been established. Not until romantic comedy, did the term musical abandon its adjectival, descriptive function and become noun-as when Warners out musical' . specific ting

Whereas the US industry has imposed a series of strong genres on audiences around the world for over half a century, genres represented by other national industries have by and large generated fewer films and have been influence of US genres weak today.

Distribution and exhibition are also heavily affected by the constitution of generic norms.

## THE GENERIC SPECTATOR

Theoreticians ofliterary genre never tire of repeating that readers always have some generic concept(s) in mind as read. Certainly, we must recognize the necessary contribution of genre to all types of comprehension, including the interpretation of films \_ Yet not all films and to the same extent While some films simply borrow devices from established genres, others foreground their generic   characteristics to the where the genre concept itself plays a major role in the film This is most obviously the case of the many recent films that parody well-known genres, but it is equally true of classic genre films. For a cinema industry based on genre films depends not only on the regular production ofrecognizably similar films , and on the maintenance of standardized system, but also on the constitution and maintenance of a stable, generically trained audience, sufficiently knowledgeable about genre systems to recognize generic cues, sufficiently familiar with genre plots to exhibit generic expectations, and sufficiently committed to generic values to tolerate and even enjoy in genre films capricious, violent, Or licentious behaviour they point

ticularly clear view of the tensions involved in generic spectatorship. Simultaneously   offering dance music, images of dancing feet, and the familiar generically coded names of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers , Hat's credits provide an obvious cue 'This is musical; clearly say 'Don't watch if you don't like musicals, but if you do your musical pleasure is guaranteed:' Now musical, as cannot exist without its three constitutive moments: meets girl, boy dances with girl, boy girl: But in Hat, from the very start, this process runs into trouble. When Astaire awakens Rogers with his nocturnal tap dancing, she does what any proper young lady in a posh hotel would do in the 1930s: rather than complaining directly to the offendnoise-maker, she complains to the management closed And there would be no musical (because there would be no meets girl') Already, at this early in the film, the spectator's allegiances are Should Rogers obey proper etiquette? Or should she shun society's definition of acceptable behaviour in favour of conduct becoming the musical? The spectator hesitates not moment: generic pleasure is always preferable to social correctness Top they 'Boy Top gets ing boy point being

Throughout Top Hat, this strategy is repeated. Generic pleasure becomes increasingly distant from and eventually antithetical to society's mores. When Astaire invites Rogers to dance, she believes that he is married to her best friend (though the spectator knows otherwise). Rogers at first hesitates to dance with Fred, once again jeopardizing OUI generic pleasure (boy dances with girl'). When ers's best friend encourages her not only to dance with Astaire, but to dance closer; the spectator is delighted, for forbidden act only heightens viewing pleasure. So far; we spectators have been successful in keeping clear of any unauthorized will 'do the right thing' , marrying her employer in order to avoid the temptation of further with Astaire, thus jeopardizing our generic pleasure yet ( gets married Rogers go for boat ride together. This time we have quite literally had to choose an adulterous liaison in order to guarantee continued generic pleasure. Rog flings again boy girl'

roundly condemns. In the horror film we actively choose the plot options that assure danger over those that guarantee safety. From one genre to another; the genre spectator always participates in overtly counter-cultural acts.

In the process of generic spectatorship we thus recognize the following elements:

- Generic audience: sufficiently familiar with thegenre to participate in a fully genre-based viewing;
- 2 Generic rules and conventions: methods of film construction and interpretation consistent with generic norms;
- 3 Generic contract: implicit agreement between genre producers (to provide advertised generic pleasures) and genre consumers (to expect and prefer specific
- between the actualization of generic norms and failure to respect those norms, often in favour of an alternative set of socially sanctioned norms;
- 5. Generic frustration: the emotion generated by film's failure to respect generic norms.

As with any signifying system, coded encounter ofa genre film with a generic audience remains subject to historical change. What was sensed as generic frustration in the studio era pleasure during the recent era of genre parody.

## GENRE HISTORY

As Hollywood's size and world-wide influence grew with the transition to sound, generic categories and generic codifcation took on new importance. Throughout the 1920s, adherence to genre norms was regularly sacrificed to the idiosyncrasies of European directors like Lubitsch, Murnau, and Stroheim; to zany comedians like Chaplin, Keaton; Langdon, Lloyd, and Normand; and to superstar directors like Griffith and DeMille who could follow their own inclinations. By the time the industry had recovered from conversion little room was left for idiosyncrasy. With few exceptions, studio financing required that standardized products roll off the production line on regular; predictable basis. Throughout the studio period, genres were more than just a convenience; were for all practical purposes commercial necessity. they

Executives of every studio shared the assumption that successful films were the product not ofindividual but of innovative adherence to general formulas. Every new generic model. When Warners produced Disraeli as their prestige production for 1929, were simply choosing pre-sold script (from the still popular 1911 Louis Napoleon Parker play) and a ready-made leading man (George Arliss, who had played the lead on the stage and in silent 6ilm genius they

version) at a time when every studio was scrambling to locate suitable properties for sound films. Expected to succeed primarily with the upmarket audiences usually referred to as the 'carriage trade' , Disraeli   enjoyed popular triumph exceeding all expectations: six months' stay in New York, consecutive world-wide run of 1,697 days in over 29,000 separate theatres, and a total audience of over 170 million spectators speaking twenty-four different languages .

with him as he left Warners to found Twentieth Century Productions. Hollywood's ultimate assayer, Zanuck always recognized when he saw it: at his new studio he would feature Arliss in a series of films capitalizing on the biography-of-a-famous-foreigner formula confirmed by Voltaire's success gold

Without Arliss, Warners was unable to compete\_ Not potential leading man for foreign biographies would Warners reap the benefits of their experiments with Arliss. Cheaply produced, Muni's first 'bio-pic The ofLouis Pasteur (1936) achieved unexWhen audiences showed little interest in a female medical heroine (Florence Nightingale in The White Angel) Warners returned to Muni for The Life of Emile Zola (1937) This time Warners had got it right, so it kept the entire team intact for Juarez two years later. This was Muni's third biography of a famous foreigner; director William Dieterle was on Story

As if scientifically assaying the film, Warners produced several series of films during the early 1930s in an attempt to discover Disraeli's formula for success: filmed stage plays, period costume dramas , films about rich statesmen Or foreign financiers, and further films directed by Alfred E of another foreign statesman came close to replicating Disraeli's popular success-Voltaire (1933).

What can we learn about genre from the example of biopics? First, while genres are sometimes borrowed constituted from literature or theatre, they can be built out of virtually any material. Secondly; every successful film not already identified with specific filmic genre triggers process of attempted genre constitution in which the studio tests series of hypotheses regarding the specific source of success Thirdly; these attempts at identifying and   replicating successful formula invariably involve organizing the studio's executive, artistic and technical personnel into semi-permanent minia successful formula is discovered, it never escapes other studios, thus leading to the constitution of full-fledged industry-wide genre. Fifthly; genres 'drift' with the formulas on which rely; just as Warners biopic heroes slide from statesmen to medical geniuses, so MGM and Fox shift from European politicians to impresarios; composers, and other musical stars, all the while retaining the same basic structure fully along they yet

This ability to reconfigure generic boundaries depends on support mechanisms equivalent to the studio publicity and journalistic criticism institutions traditionally exploited by cinema industries to anchor and perpetuate genre norms. If the notion of film noir gained cinema studies as an academic and cultural industry. strong

It is important to note that film producers are not the only players in While some film genres are recycled from literary or theatrical sources, and others are primarily developed within the cinema industry; still others can be constituted after the fact by critics or audiences. What we today call 'film noir' , for example\_ critics. Cutting = across genres which Hollywood had known by names as various as gangster' 'crime' , 'detective' , hard-boiled' , or 'psychological thriller' , the notion of film noir stressed different set of traits shared by many wartime attention from similar plot material to a common atmosphere derived from character type, dialogue style; and lighting choices.

When genres develop from their initial adjective-based breadth to a more focused nounoriented definition; develop certain 'syntactic" consistency by regularly deploying similar methods of making the various semphors, aesthetic hierarchies, and the like\_ While any film located in the American West might well be characterized as Western, there are films that employ western trappings simply to justify western song, induce horse laugh, Or study Indian customs, and those that systematically oppose expanding civilization to dwindling wilderness, concretize community-supporting laws and divisive individualism in two sets of diametrically opposed characters, and internalize those oppositions in complex hero combining certain attributes of both sides. they

Today, the fragmentation of both media and audiences, the ability to target specific audience seg ments, makes it more probable than ever before that new generic configurations will be constituted by contemporary audiences using old genres in new ways. While far

genre history is to recognize that genres depend on two related but quite different aspects. Minimally; all films of particular genre share certain separate elements that we may call we recognize film as a Western when we see some combination of horses , rough-and-tumble characters , illegal acts , semi-settled wilderness, natural earth colours , trackshots, and general respect for the actual history of the American West (to name but few of the extremely diverse semantic elements that characterize the Western) ing

Film genres typically share common semantic features; genre films build common semantic features into a shared syntax. The meanings carried by semantic elements are usually borrowed from pre-existing social codes; syntactic features, on theother hand more fully express the specific meaning of particular genre. When genres are said to to the syntax that critics refer.

It has often French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss , that genres serve ritual purpose, providing repeated imaginary solution to the questions raised by society's constitutive contradictions. Viewed in this manner, the Western is seen to negotiate the opposing American values of individual freedom and community action, respect for the environment and need for industrial growth, Or reverence the and desire to build a new future Thus understood , genre films are produced by the cinema industry only at the behest of a specific audience, which uses films as mode of cultural 'thinking'. for past

Other critics have seen genre films as an especially economical form of afar; spectators are allowed to believe that they are getting Viewed in this manner; the Western appears as a complex way to justify seizure of Indian lands, substitution of the institution of a stable regime in the West based on secure settlement, transportation, and communication. In other words, the Western is an apology for the 'Manifest Destiny' doctrine and an excuse for the commercial exploitation of western lands and resources

Overall it seems most fruitful to recognize that successful studio film production depends to a certain extent on both functions. The longevity of film genres would be explained by a continued ability to achieve one OI the other of these goals, while the special complexity and strength of genre films grows out of their capacity to fulfil both   functions   simultaneously. The process lishing a common ground between the audience's ritual values and the industry's ideological commitments. The develop ment ofa specific syntax within a given semantic context thus serves a double function:it binds element to element in logical order; at the same time accommodating audience desires to studio concerns. The successful genre owes its success not only to its reflection of an audience ideal, nor solely to its status as apology for the Hollywood enter prise, but to its ability to carry out both functions simultaneously. It is this sleight of hand, this strategic overdetermination; that most clearly characterizes successful genre film production.

## The Western

Between 1910 and 1960 the Western was the major genre of the world's dominant national cinema. Its popularity was a vital factor in establishing Hollywood's control of the But the development of the Western as distinctive formula within popular culture; invention of the cinema by a quarter of a century. moments in the history of white expansion across the North American continent had decisive effect. In the aftermath of the Civil War cattle ranchers on the Texas plains were desperate to find a market for their livestock. As the railways spread through Kansas on their way to trail to the new towns of Abilene and Dodge City; strung out along the track. Ihe cowboy; whose accoutrements and life-style derived mainly from the Hispanic mythic figure, on nothing but his horse, his gun, and his own manly virtues. Also at this a full-scale conflagration, with series of Indian wars across the plains, culminating in the spectacular and trauthe Indian, whether in the of the noble redman Or the screaming savage, was rapidly incorporated into range of fictional and quasi documentary   discourses, including the other forms of visual and narrative representation. Two long guise

Though the cowboy and the Indian were to remain the central figures , a motley crew of outlaws, mountain men, soldiers , and lawmen were also pressed into service as Western heroes by the rapidly developing communication popular fiction in the form of dime novels featured stories based on real-life personalities such as Jesse James , the Kid, and Wild Bill Hickok, as well as fictional characters  like Deadwood Dick. Many of these were also the heroes of stage melodramas. artistic forms of fiction also began to draw on Western themes. Just after the turn of the century; in 1902, Owen Wister's The Virginian provided the definitive portrait ofthecowboy combination of natural gentleman and resolute were also employing the talents of artists such as Frederic Remington to visualize and embroider events out on the plains. Most influential of all, in 1883 Buffalo Bill Cody began touring with his   circus-style Wild West enter-tainment\_ This included such crypto-narratives as the Battle ofSummit Springs, in which Codyrode to the rescue Billy hero,

The sheer variety of situations, locations; and character types that have attached themselves to the Western has resulted in a form which at times appears fluid, eclectic, and lacking any discernible centre. A generic category such as the Western, however; is more usefully understood employed by the film industry to identify and differentiate its products. The cinema Western, therefore cannot prop erly be said to have existed until the industry began to separate out the Western from other films  involving lawless acts, and until it had put the term into circulation as useful description of But the process was remarkably rapid. Aided no doubt by the fact that the film audience had already encountered Western emergent cinema soon developed a recognizable kind of narrative which displayed distinctive combination of features

First; the films are set on the frontier; the dividing line between white civilization and its opposite, 'savagery' . On the one side are law and order, community; the values of settled society. On the other; the outlaw and the savage Indian. Following the landmark essay of FrederickJackson American historians concurred in fixing 1890 as the year in which the frontier finally disappeared and the continent was deemed pacified. This ended organized resistance by the majority of Westerns, even those with no very exact historical setting; situate themselves within the period 1865 90, though this limit can extend earlier and if frontier conditions are deemed to exist. Similarly; the geographical location is usually west of the Mississippi, north of the Rio Grande, but ifthe film is set in earlier times the location may be further east; and locations in Mexico may also qualify as the 'frontier' The basic conflict develops from struggle between the forces of civilization and savagery; and the narrative features lawless acts by those who, because of the frontier location; are beyond the pale of civilization. These acts require forcible retribution ific time and place, and transgressive act which these specifics make possible and which because of the nature have later

The Great Train Robbery could not boast an authentic frontier location, since it was shot in New Jersey. The first productions shot in western locations were those of the Selig-Polyscope Company in 1907. Titles such as The Girl from Montana were advertised in the trade press as set 'in the wildest and most beautiful scenery of the Western country' Their success encouraged other companies to relocate westwards In 1909 the appropriately named Bison Company, specialists in Westerns, moved to Calfilm star.

One of the performers signed by Ince was a veteran stage actor named William S. Hart, who brought to the emergent genre all the moral fervour of the Victorian melodrama in which he had received his theatrical training. Hart developed the persona of the Good Badman, a figure on the fringeofrespectable society who is redeemed by the love of a pure woman; whom he is called upon to rescue from the clutches of villainy. From 1915 Hart was making feature-length films for the Triangle Company, still in association with Ince. In their plots and characterization the films reveal Hart's stage origins; he had appeared in theatrical versions of Owen Wister's The Virginian and The Squaw Man, a play which became a Cecil B. DeMille film in 1913 and probably the first feature-length striking use of the western landscape and their décors managed to give a real feel of the rather mean little towns that sparsely populated the West. dusty,

Hart took both himself and the West very seriously. The cowboy star who was to replace him in the public imagination, Tom Mix, was very different type. Hart's horsemanship was no more than adequate.

He had worked on the very same 101 Ranch which had merged with Bison, and all his life retained links with Wild West shows and circuses .

## THE CLASSIC WESTERN

The 1930s saw the series Western flourish once it had adjusted to the introduction of sound which initially presented problems for location shooting: Around the middle of the decade film exhibitors , attempting to reverse the decline of audiences caused by the Depression, initiated the double bill, which offered two feature films per programme. A ready supply of needed to fill the bill, and poverty studios such as Monogram rushed to provide them More prestigious productions were few and the decade, which saw modest revival. John Ford reentered the field with Stagecoach  (1939), produced by Walter Wanger United Artists after Ford had failed to interest David 0. Selznick. The picture revived the career of John Wayne, who had been languishing in 'poverty row' since the failure of Raoul Walsh's epic The Big Trail in 1930. trio of Westerns turned out by major studios in the same year.

The move towards historical subjects, albeit in fanciful versionswas indicative that Hollywood was disposed to take the Western more seriously. In the 1940s the studios sawthat the Western could be a vehicle for the exploration of moral issues. In dealing with lynching The Ox-Bow Incident (1942) exposed the hypocrisy of respectable society. In 1940 the Western discovered sex; when Howard Hughes Russell. Hughes's determination to exploit Russell's sex appeal to

High Noon (1952) was another film which looked beneath the glamour of a life lived by the gun. Its director, Fred Zinnemann, has always denied that the film was political parable. But its story of a sheriff who has to stand alone against the bad guys when those whoshould support him prove cowards was generally read as commentary on the McCarthyism that was laying waste Hollywood gun-

One was the Civil War film The Horse Soldiers (1959) The other was film little regarded at the time but now widely judged to be not only Ford's finest but perhaps the greatest Western of them all. The Searchers (1956) is profound and troubexamination of the psychopathology of 'the Indian fighter' , pivotal figure in the myth of the West whose origins go back to the beginnings of Western narrative in the eighteenth century. It is also the supreme example of the visual splendour of the western landscape, which has been such an indelible of the appeal of the genre. string Earp trilogy ling part

The 1950s were marked notonly by an increased seriousness in the thematic content of Westerns. It was also decade in which aesthetic possibilities were realized with greater verve and flair than ever before. George Stevens's Shane (1952) was singled out by André Bazin (1971) as an example ofwhat he called the 'sur-Western' , which 'would be ashamed to be just itself, and looks for some additional

interest to justify its existence~an aesthetic; sociological; some quality extrinsic to the genre and which is supposed to enrich it'. Of course it is in the nature of genre that it seeks constantly to renew 'itselfby adding novel variations. But a definite tendency towards pictorialism is observable in Stevens's careful shots of the Grand Tetons, and the figure of Shane himself, seen through the eyes of the logized.

With the exception of The Tin Star (1957), all of Mann's last eight Westerns were in colour, and four of them were in CinemaScope. The Western profited Hollywood's determination to compete with television through enhanced technology. By the end ofthe decade colour and widescreen had become the norm\_ were nowhere better exploited than in another on a close relation between a star and director, which revived the career of veteran Western star Randolph Scott and established Budd Boetticher as one of the Western's Now (1956), established the character Scott was to play, stoical and implacable beneath his laconic exterior, usually bent upon revenge for some grievous wrong done to him. This partnership, usually in tandem with the script-writer Burt Kennedy, continued through The Tall T (1956) Decision at Sundown (1957), Buchanan (1957), Westbound   (1958), Ride   Lonesome, and Comanche Station (both 1959). from They cycle

genre before that time. Kitses not only attempted to define which auteurs were the inheritors and developers of the Fordian legacy, but tried to provide a definition of the Western by adapting Lévi-Strauss's structuralist analysis of myth. Kitses's  identifcation of central antithesis between wilderness and civilization, from which all other conflicts derive was persuasive and was further developed by Will Wright in more orthodoxly structuralist work, Sixguns and Society (1975). Since then, there have been notable works on individual directors, stars , and films, but little of consequence on the genre itself, with the exception of Richard Slotkin's Gunfighter Nation a commentary on American political ideology.

In 1950 Hollywood had produced 130 Western features.

The cynicism at the heart of the Italian Western about values of civilization, progress , community family; and the rule of law doubtless derived from the fashionable Marxism of intellectual Italian film-makers . But this in turn had its effect on Hollywood, accentuating an already discernible drift towards 'exposing' previous pieties. In the 1970s debunking sacred COWS became almost obligatory; whether it was Wyatt Earp in Doc (1971) General Custer in Little Big Man (1970), Billy the Kid in Little Billy (1972) or Buffalo Bill in Buffalo Bill and the Indians Minnesota Raid (1971),intheso-called 'mud andrags' mode, rubbed the audience's noses in the squalor of what the West was 'really' like.

The conservative certainties to which the Western had seemed indissolubly wedded were held up for a searching reexamination\_ The white male protagonist, previously impregnable, now found himself undermined\_ The distinctly un-macho Jack Crabb (Dustin Hoffman) in Little Big Man was one in an increasingly long line of anti-heroes. In Hannie Caulder (1971) Raquel Welch played a raped and vengeful woman rampaging against the entire male sex.

Two films in 1992 proved, in different ways, that the genre had not after all exhausted itself. The Last of the Mohicans showed that the mythic fictions of the founding father of the Western Fenimore Cooper, could be updated for modern audiences who would find his prose unreadable And in Unforgiven Clint Eastwood made a film which combined traditional satisfactions (the bad guys are decisively defeated) with fashionably contemporary Angst about the morality of violence

Many theories have been advanced as to why the Western ingly urban society could not relate to an agrarian genre, office demographics probably had their effect. A younger audience was drawn to genres like horror and science fiction which offered more sensational thrills; by contrast, youth in the Western seemed perpetually condemned to be taught a lesson by its elders and betters. What is incontrovertible is that the failure of the elephantine and grossly indulgent Heaven's Gate (1980) to recover even proportion of its huge costs made Hollywood executives wary of further adventures out west. The 1980s was the Western's worst ever decade and production fell away to a trickle Between 1980 and 1992 even the last great hope, Clint Eastwood, got back in the saddle only once, for Pale Rider (1985).

In 1911 film versions of popular operas (Pathé's Il trovatore and Edison's Aïda) were distributed with specially arranged music. In Europe, films like Johan Gildemeijer's Gloria transita (1917) and Gloria fatalis (1922) employed similar system, with live musicians singing the operatic arias mouthed by the characters on screen. Throughout the silent their stories with visible musical sources in order to provide overt opportunities for the use of 'cue' music (i.e live music synchronized to specific on-screen cues like bugle calls, organ song nings

Starting in the late 1920s, cinemas around the world exploited new sound technology by building scenarios on a generous dose of diegetic music. In the United States, producers   called on every conceivable musical source: opera, operetta, classical music, military marches, VienTin Pan Alley tunes, nightclub numbers; vaudeville routines, jazz riffs, and even burlesque favourites Ever since, the musical genre has been characterized by its ability to assimilate each new musical style, from to rock and from be-bop to heavy metal. swing

The musical diversity of the 1920s and early 1930s was matched by the breadth of narrative traditions invoked. Paramount's European directors Ernst Lubitsch and Rouben Mamoulian repeatedly called upon European male music hall stars Jack Buchanan and Maurice Chevalier to partner American opera singer Jeanette MacDonald late

Expandon the sophisticated iróny used with his sister Adele (with whom he never played straight romantic roles) Astaire fostered an overtly competitive on-screen relationship with Rogers. Fed by the evolving conventions of contemporaneous screwball comedy, this approach led to the Astaire-Rogers   signature where a personality clash is acted out in a competitive dance ( Isn't this a Lovely 'Let Yourself Go' , 'Pick Yourself up' All Laughed' , 'Lets Call the Whole off), eventually leading to the opponents' recognition of their love, later acted out in a more traditional romantic dance ('Cheek to Cheek' .

by a single successful film, all borrow plots and themes from pre existing Rio Rita brought music to the Western, while King Vidor's Hallelujah!

Nearly every studio included music in comedy, often with football subplot (for example, MGM in Good  News, Paramount in Sweetie, First National in Forward Pass). college

The most important influence of the period was exercised by the Al Jolson tear-jerker The Singing Fool (Warners, 1928), along with MGM's 1929 backstage love triangle studio immediately and repeatedly turned to production of musical melodramas featuring an unlucky-in-love performer; faithless spouse, gangster subplot, singer on the skids, or dying child.

As often happens when a popular film is widely imitated in an effort to capitalize on its success, these early musical films shared surface characteristics: diegetic music, performers as main characters,  performance-heavy plots an unabashed display of the latest technology: While a stable genre might have been formed around these films' romantic treatment of music as the the contemporary press followed Hollywood's own publicity in failing to configure musical films as an independent genre. Not until the public tired of musical films in 19301 (from fifty-five musical films in 1929 and seventy-seven 1931 and ten in 1932-the industry low point until the 1960s) did critics regularly use the term 'musical' as a standalone substantive; usually employed to denigrate the production of the previous years, which in retrospect appeared standardized and limited. While this new recognition of generic coherence might well have led to selfconscious production of melodramatic musicals as genre films, the box-office failings ofmusical films enforced a defacto moratorium on their production, and thus rupture between the somewhat morose tone of early musical films and the upbeat attitude characteristic of the post-1933 musical.

## THE CLASSICAL HOLLYWOOD MUSICAL

The year 1933 constitutes a new beginning in Hollywood's attempts to produce economically viable combinations of music and narrative. Until 1933 there had been nounced   dichotomy between the  operetta and other

musical films Because of the which their plots, characters, and music were derived and budgets that required-these two strains failed to be conceived as single genre. Early operettas such as The Love Parade or New Moon maintained light tone and nearly always concluded with a happy ending, while other musical films often depended on the tear-jerking techniques of popular melodrama they

the genre's spread to every conceivable plot line. No longer grafted to melodramatic stock, but instead mated with romantic comedy, the musical moved into such areas as the biopic (The Great Ziegfeld, 1936; The Jolson Story; 1946; Night and The Glenn Miller Story; 1953) the troop show (For Me and my Gal 1942), the fashion show (Cover Girl, 1944), Or even revivified operetta (especially in MGM's extremely successful pairing of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy in Naughty Marietta (1935), Rose-Marie (1936), and subsequent films) Day

In 1933 Warners began to produce musicals of a new type Whereas previous musical films had by and large simply added music to familiar stories, 42nd Street, Footlight Parade, Gold Diggers of 1933, and the 1934 Dames all equate successful   music-making with Ihe opulent song-and-dance spectacles of these films (all choreographed by Busby Berkeley) thus openly celebrate the romance of young stars Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, go on. In this new musical world there is no room for plots are redesigned to further the young   couple's romance while celebrating their love through the energy of song and dance \_

While this new musical structure first appeared in Warners' backstage films, its popularity eventually facilitated

During the mid-1930s, the musical genre developed a of a number of semantic and syntactic features:

It was also in 1933 that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers the public's imagination. Astaire had enjoyed a distinguished stage career with his sister Adele   (and film début that year in MGM's Busby chorus parts (42nd Street, Gold Diggers of 1933), it was their pairing in Flying down to Rio that first introduced them to the public as couple, thus inaugurating distinguished series of RKO films which, like the Warners' backstage musicals,   consistently use song and dance to celebrate the main couple's romance What is more, with songs tailored for Astaire and Rogers by the Divorcee (1934); Jerome Kern for Roberta (1934) and Time (1936); Irving Berlin for Hat (1935), Follow the We Dance (1937)) each number of the Astaire-Rogers films plays an active role in the making of the couple. The Astaire-Rogers films had stabilizing effect on the genre, for they  bridged the gap between the fancy costumes and faraway upperclass sets of operetta and the down-to-earth plots and hummable music of the Tin Pan vaudeville, or folk traditions\_ Whereas in 1930 there was no single coherent broad-based musical genre by middecade films even Night at the Opera (1935) could all be designated by single generic term: the musical. girl Swing Top Alley

These semantic determinants are common to many musical films , but there are also certain syntactic relations evidenced only by those films that constitute the nucleus of the genre:

- 1 Narrative strategy: Dual-focus . The film alternates between male and female partners (or groups), estab lishing parallels between the two; identifying each with specific cultural value, and eventually pro voking their confrontation and merger.
- 2. Couplelplot: Parallelism (andlor causal link) between couple formation and plot resolution. Courtship is thus always closely connected to some other aspect of the film's thematic material.
- 3. Musiclplot: Music and dance as expression of personal and communal joy. As signifiers of romantic triumph over every possible limitation, music and dance serve celebratory purpose.
- 4 Narrativelnumber: Continuity between realism and rhythm, dialogue and diegetic music. The musical's oppositions exist only to be resolved; following the American mythology ofmarriage as a mystical union of the couple
- 5. Imagelsound: Classical narrative hierarchy (image treatment gives way gradually to a realm of rhythm and rhyme) we enter world where actions keep time to the music, rather than the more familiar situation where sound is   produced by and synchronized with imaged actions.

While not every classical   Hollywood at children lack central romantic couple) the vast majority of Hollywood's musical production during the film era-corresponds to this definition\_

Hollywood's self consciousness about the genre is especially clear in the many post-war attempts to build musicals around overt reflection on the genre. Though such films might easily have led to a serious critique of the genre, instead they reaffirm its implied values At first expressed in passing, through inversion or foregrounding of familiar motifs (as in the send-up of backstage clichés in the 1941 Ziegfeld Girl), the 'reflexive' or 'selfreflexive'

scripted by Betty Comden and Adolph Green such as The Barkleys of Broadway (1948), On the Town (1949), Singin' in the (1955). Even in the many cases where musicals treat alcoholism, gangster attacks, or premature death-as in A Star is Born (1954), Oklahoma! (1955) Porgy and Bess (1959), OI West Side (1961) clever scripting   constantly manages to build a new society around loving couple (beyond the grave if necessary), with the energy of music and dance celebrating their union Story

After a of rather unimaginative Broadway adaptations (My Fair Lady, 1964; The Sound of Music, 1965), remakes (A Star is Born; 1976) compilations (That's Entertainment, and musical films for children  (Mary Poppins; 1964),in the late 1970s the musical surprised even its most avid followers with a strong revival. Some ofthese films were irreverent send-ups of show-business conventions (Robert Altman's 1976 Nashville and Bob Fosse's 1980 All that Jazz); some were mild remembrances of plots past (Martin Scorsese's 1977 New York, New York, Stanley ing Saturday Night Fever (1978), Hair (1979,directed by Miloš Forman) renewed ability to integrate contemporary music and mores into period

## CATEGORIES OF THE MUSICAL

Critics of the musical have long differentiated among musical plots, performance traditions, and production methods. Important divisions of the musical into sub genres have been based on the following criteria (and led to the problems enumerated).

Studio

Pinpointing 'house style' founded on the success of small group of films, studio distinctions often stress particular stars or production personnel. Paramount is noted for the performances of Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald in sophisticated European operettas directed by Ernst Lubitsch or Rouben Mamoulian. Warners is identified with backstage plots in realistic urban locations \_ where hoofer Ruby Keeler and a chorus of girls carry out Busby Berkeley's choreography; while crooner Dick Powell warbles songs by Al Dubin and Harry Warren. RKO's screwball comedy scripts combine elegant dancers Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers with offbeat comics Edward Everett Horton and Eric Blore in Van Nest Polglase's classy art deco sets. Fox offers folksy; regional productions featuring blonde stars Alice Faye, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Shirley Temple MGM is touted for its stable of stars Ueanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy before the war; Cyd Charisse, Judy Garland, Gene Kelly; Frank Sinatra, Esther

Williams, andan older Fred Astaire in the 194Os and 1950s) duction values and complex choreography are assured by outstanding production personnel (virtuoso editor Slavko Vorkapich; script-writers Betty Comden and Adolph producers Arthur Freed and Joe Pasternak) and dance-sensitive directors (Busby Berkeley, Stanley Donen, Vincente Minnelli, George Sidney; Charles Walters)  Useful as an introductory classification\_ this approach tends to overe 'mphasize a single aspect of each studio's production; while concealing important resemblances and influences among studios.

## Director

Auteur critics concentrated on genre's most innovative directors (Lubitsch, Mamoulian, Minnelli, Donen, Fosse). However, auteur criticism of the musical often tends to mask the contributions of nondirectorial personnel and of functions other than directper se\_ More attention deserves to be to other sources of innovation and consistency in the musical, notably choreography and performance Berkeley and Walters both started as choreographers; Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly did their own choreography (and Kelly also while Singers too Chevalier; MacDonald, Crosby; Garland-give a distinct character to films And no history of the Hollywood musical is possible without recognizing the role of producers such as Arthur Freed at MGM and Joe Pasternak; who produced string of Deanna Durbin musicals for Universal in the 1930s . have ing paid in)

## Method of introducing music

While stage conventions fully motivate backstage musical numbers, and the operetta tradition offers only psycho logical motivation for its musical outbursts (and instant accompaniment) the socalled 'integrated musical naturalizes its song-and-dance contrived situations, sets, or character penchants (a convenient piano, an empty stage, public dance family singalong, characters who 'just can'tstop singing' Or dancing). Usually deployed as part of a historical argument whereby the musical 'improves by abandoning artificiality in favour of integration, this approach enfranchises the many musicals that self-consciously seek artificiality or (like The Band Wagon) deliberately mix the two elements. It remains useful, however, as method of concentrating attention on the articulation between narrative and spectacle

## Audience

As the apparently homogeneous audienceofthe 1930s succumbed to post-war and then post-modern fragmentation Hollywood   increasingly targeted separate audiences\_ Depending on such criteria as character age, musicalstyle, and the role of romance; musicals may be distinguished by their While this distinction is useful for descriptive purposes it obscures important aspects of the genre's history and structure\_ Classifying musicals by their intended audience conceals the genre's careful creation of spectator position requiring a combination of adult and childlike qualities (sexual maturity and innocent optimism) It also fails to recognize Hollywood's systematic attempt to bridge audience sectors with films that provide 'something for everyone' (as when Shirley Temple plays Cupid, Disney's of Broadway and Dancing mix the music and dance Dirty

## SEMANTICS AND SYNTAX

Careful inspection of the genre's basic materials (musical traditions, dance acting styles , costuming interests) suggests an alternative approach to the musical and a threefold division which is confirmed by analysis of syntactic concerns (especially the set of activities associmaking of couple) yielding the following subgenres:

of order in the romantic coupling process parallel (and often causally related) to the restoration of order in an imaginary kingdom. Guiding metaphor: to marry is to govern

The show musical. Set in the Manhattan centred modern middleclass world of theatre and publishing, the show musical associates the constitution of a couple with the creation of a show (vaudeville routine, Broadway play; Hollywood film fashion concert)   Guiding metaphor: to marry is to create.

## THE MUSICAL

The folk musical. Set in the America of yesteryear, from two entire group's communion with each other and with the land that sustains them Guiding metaphor: marriage is community.

Each of these subgenres overtly celebrates one particular value associated with the genre as In the tale musical (so named for its tendency to predicate the future of a kingdom on the romance of a 'princess and stresses the musical's tendency toward transcendence of duction paralleling the couple's success) maximizes the of joy through music and dance. The folk musical (after the characters , music, and general   atmosphere)   plays up the communitarianism characteristic of the musical's choral tendencies. fairy-

While these subgenres develop separately, may of course be combined in interesting waysThus Rose-Marie transfers the typical operetta trappings of the fairy-tale musical to regional location more typical of the folk musical, while Brigadoon (1954) combines a folk semantics with fairy-tale syntax. Similarly, Fred Astaire seems to carry with him the aristocratic underpinnings of the tale tradition even when he is cast in show musicals like Easter Parade (1948), The Barkleys of Broadway; or The Band Wagon, while Gene Kelly and Judy Garland exude a folk paradigm even in a fairy-tale musical like The Pirate (1948) they fairy-

Often linked to the development of sound film techthe history of the musical is actually much better understood through Hollywood's changing relationship to the US music distribution system. In 1929 Warner Bros began to acquire music publishing companies in an effort to reduce the overall cost of obtaining music sound films. Other studios soon followed suit; with many going so far as to back Broadway musical plays in order to secure Never entirely abandoned reached its height in the 1950s with Columbia's financing of My Fair Lady.

Warners used music from their own musicals their 'Looney Tunes" and Merrie Melodies' cartoon series. In the 1940s, Paramount used love songs from early 1930s musicals as dance or atmospheric music in women's films, melodramas , and films noir. In the early 1950s, MGM used the song catalogues of specific songwriters as the basis for innovative Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown for Singin' in the Rain, Harold Dietz and Arthur Schwartz for The Band Wagon) while other studios raided their song catalogues to make innumerable musical biopics . for

Among these practices, none was more important than the American myth of courtship; which the musical consistently embodied throughout history.

A prolific director at MGM for over three decades, Vincente Minnelli made important contributions to someof the most celebrated entertainments in history. American critics in the 1940s praised his sophistication and American aùteurists in the 1950s and 1960s regarded him as a sly satirist of bourgeois values.

During Hollywood 's heyday the musical played a central role in the American public sphere: Its coherence; homogeneity; and ubiquity guaranteed continuity ofinterpretation and meaning.

Cultural uses of the musical are now controlled by the music industry, the mass media, and even special interest groups for whom musical film offers unique opportunity for selfexpression \_

Musketeers was an early example of the American crime film, and one, moreover; that deals with crime in manner that has reverberated throughout the genre down the years\_ The opening shots and title indicate an underworld that coexists with the world we know, and the last one shows how the two are connected. In between Griffith tells the slight story of an innocent couple almost overSnapper Kid, who has been smitten by Lillian Gish as the innocent wife

Much has been written about Griffith's borrowings from Charles Dickens in his depiction of poverty, but the narrative of Musketeers is more revealing of his borrowings from more simply structured Victorian melodramas and under- and overworlds and the point where the two come into collision is often the attempted seduction of an innocent. The classic literary examples of this are Eugène Sue's Les Mystères de Paris (1842-3) and the many pulps written by former police reporter George Lippard in the USA in the 1840s

The importance of this structure for the crime novel and film lay in its flexibility and adaptability as metaphor of social relations.

Fritz Lang's Dr Mabuse films (Dr Mabuse der Spieler ('Dr Mabuse the gambler'), 1922; Spione ('Spies'), 1928; Das Testament des Dr Mabuse ('Dr Mabuse's will'), 1933; and even Die tausend Augen des Dr Mabuse ('The thousand eyes of Dr Mabuse'), 1960) also take as a central notion the contrast between under- and overworlds and the codes that govern them. These flms look backward to Victorian notions of conspiracy; but a film title as early as Underworld (Joseph von Sternberg, 1927) and as late as Underworld USA core of the idea. Further examples of the tenacity of this opposition can be seen in films as different as Lang's M (1931), in which the two worlds temporarily unite to seek a killer whose crimes are considered to break the rules of civilized society; Basil Dearden's The Blue Lamp (1950), in associate with the young tearaways played by Dirk Bogarde and Patrick Doonan because donot understand about the need for restraint; and Samuel Fuller's Pickup on South Street (1953), in which a professional informer will not sell information to an enemy of her country even at the cost of life\_ they her

Seen from this perspective, although The Musketeers of Pig Alley may be simply constructed; its articulation ofthe narrative device of seduction[rape within the structure of a contrast between the over- and underworlds is modern Ia ther than Victorian. Particularly striking is the film's ending, which only offers moment of respite, a truce between the conflicting forces rather than victory. Also noteworthy is the fact that the Snapper Kid is both prototype hero and villain. In Victorian melodrama and pulp fiction the theme of seductionJrape and the underworldJoverworld contrast are generally held tightly and straightforwardly together. In crime films (and twentiethcentury crime novels) the two remain closely connected but are often developed in variety of different ways. As Ian Cameron (1975) has forcefully pointed out, of all the film genres 'no genre has been more consistently shaped by factors outside the cinema than the crime movie To explain the development ofthe crime movie itis therefore necessary to explore the social reasons that lie behind the changes in the narrative strategies to which the crime movie repeatedly returns

the late 1920s and early 1930s. The gangster film literally began with stories ripped from the front pages of the nation's newspapers (and often written for the screen by former reporters) about the effects of prohibition. But the genre did not spring to life formed The groundbreaking Underworld and Scarface (Howard Hawks, 1932), both of which were written by former reporter Ben Hecht, are particularly interesting in this respect. Hecht wrote the first when the genre did not exist as such and the second when the ground rules of the genre had been established. narrative strand and the rise-and-fall scenario that would be oft repeated and, like so many later films, were clearly grounded in reality (even to the point of restaging particular events, like the St Valentine's Massacre, and featuring characters clearly based on real gangsters). Similarly both included many of the iconographic elements that would be featured in later films-the gang, the moll, the newspaper man, the shyster lawyer, the nightclub Yet both, especially if one compares them with the likes of Little Caesar (Mervyn Leroy; 1930) or Public Enemy (William Wellman, 1931), are far from pure genre films (which in great part is their strength) fully Day

Yet in many ways it is also the more modern of the two films\_ In the characters of Brent and Brook it solves the  problem which the greater   realism of the gangster film posed for the seduction/rape scenario aspect Both characters embody the social aspirations that Bancroft, though possessing crude power (he a silver dollar in half) can only mimic but will never attain.

Brent's Feathers   also is the start of line the first of many molls caught in matrix of conflicting emotions Underworld thus adds to the underworld| overworld contrast a social dimension which fleshed out the robber baron element of gangsterdom and would be consistently picked up by later films.

Scarface is a far more complex film. Essentially a family drama-director Hawks told Hecht he wanted it to be like the story of the Borgias set in Chicagoit has at its core

In other words, Scarface is as much a Howard Hawks film as a gangster film. Tony

This manic energy can be seen in virtually all early gangster films. Consider Little Caesar and Public Enemy (both different aspects of the energetic drive to success. In Little cality and desire for social esteem that verges on the psychotic. In Public Enemy, Cagney's drive to gangsterism is terms of family (his father is policeman) but at the centre is a delight in fast cars and shootouts that is almost infantile. These films set the template for the genre throughout the 1930s. Changes would take place: in the wake of the popularity of federal agent Melvin Purvis after the shooting down of Dillinger

If prohibition and the events of Chicago provided the factual basis of the gangster film genre, its popularity stemmed in no small part from its articulation of the complex network of feelings generated in the USA by the The Gangster as Tragic Hero' (1948): 'The gangster is the 'no" to the great American which is stamped Warshaw's essay (though occasionally rather too broad in its generalizations) highlights a central truth about 1930s gangster films and their reception. Let down themselves by established official society; audiences the Depression cheered on the gangsters (often folk heroes in real life as well as on the screen)  sharing with them, if only in spirit, the delight of putting on evening dress and mixing with those to whom evening dress was birthright. In this the appeal of the the show musical" in which the little people put on show and finally win the approval of those in charge, but only after fierce opposition, with the added bonus of the immediate translation of one of their number from sup porting role to star. There is a further similarity between early musicals central role of energy in both, be it flashing tapping feet, blazing machine guns, Or car chases. (It is no accident that the intensely dynamic James Cagney was a star of both.) It is this energy and social climbing (both features of displaced sexuality) that make the early gangster an optimistic figure and at the same time a tragic one, doomed because his energy can never be enough. during

## FROM GANGSTERS TO FILM NOIR

By the beginning of the 1940s the gangster as a figure had lost much of his power and was no longer a mirror of the misogyny of a Cagney (in Public Enemy) thrusting grapefruit into the face of Mae Marsh was no longer an later (as when Lee Marvin throws boiling coffee at Gloria into the war in 1942 meant big changes in the position of women which made their portrayal as mere girlfriends problematic. Traditional models representing sex] gender relations came increasingly into conflict with the realities of a world where women were over men's jobs (and looking after the home while their husbands labour did not immediately affect the content of genres such as the crime film. It is more the case, as sociologists Edhol, Harris , in Denning 1987) suggest, that the emerging contradiction between the sexlgender system and the sexual division of labour 'prOvided a potential for struggle and questioning, for sexual hostility and antagonism' . Indirectly this contradiction was to work its way into the metaphoric structure of the crime film genre. for taking

While the cultural response to this change in the crime film (let alone cinema at large) cannot be 'read off in advance' once the changed condition is noted it is easy to see how different crime films of the 1940s are from those of the preceding decade\_ simple role reversal that follows from this change is that of seducer and seducee (The Postman Always Twice Garnett, 1946) Another feature of the crime films of the 1940s is that partner' s name (Phantom Lady, Robert Siodmak, 1944). It is also worth noting that masculine energy is not a common feature of film noir; surely the most languid of subgenres In film noir the way (wo)man held cigarette was as important as the way (s)he held In the same way narrative, plot in which energy was essential, is little found in film noir (and when it is it is ironically bookended by flashbacks, as in Mildred Michael Curtiz, 1946) The rise-and-fall structure is replaced by that of the investigation; often in a present that is seemingly stretched to fill the running time of a One Rings Tay gun.

Just how much the landscape of the crime film changed during the 1940s can be seen in the changing form taken by the contrast between the over- and underworlds\_ In number of films noir of the 1940s, corruption ruled and the two worlds sat (often all too easily) side by side with representatives of each world often having a role within the other world as well. Thus the police were expected to be corrupt and the man running the local night-club was expected to be criminal (The Big Howard Hawks, ingly; however, what came to be at issue and under examination was not the group and society but the individual and divided self. For just as the war brought about radical change in the cultural pattern of life in America, so the influx of European émigrés increased the speed of dissemination in American intellectual life of the ideas associated with Sigmund Freud. As psychology and psychoanalysis found their way to Hollywood in the late Sleep,

1940s provided writers and directors with the image of an overand underworld within single person (consciousness and the unconscious). Two chapter headings from Parker Tyler's seminal book on the cinema, Finding Freudianism Photogenic' and 'Schizophrenia à la Mode'~wittily sum upthe impact of Freudian ideas on Hollywood. But notions of doubleness and divided identity also came in via artists steeped in the Romantic tradition OF who had worked in the German expressionist cinema in the 1920s. This influence was to surface first in the horror film of the 1930s and then in 1940s film noir. they

Dashiel Hammett's novel and one of the earliest films noir, is a convenient 'starting-point from which to examine changes in the narrative strategies of the crime film and the emergence of noir as the dominant form of the genre an obscure object of value harks back to plots from Victorian times and earlier (Wilkie Collins's The Moonstone is and in Sydney Greenstreet's gro tesque Gutman there is character very similar to the

same author's Count Fosco). The film's hero, Sam Spade (played by Humphrey Bogart) is neither a saint nor sinner but vulnerable and emotional man whose rejection of Astor sums the battered would-be romantic heroism to perfection: 'You'll never understand me, but Ill try to explain When a man's partner is killed hes supposed to do something about it. It doesn't make any difference what you thought of him, he was your partner and you're sup to do something about it. The speech marks the transition from theedgy freneticism ofthe Cagney characters of the 1930s to the crumpled and world-weary charm of the Bogart characters of the 1940s. And then there is Astor herself, strong, manipulative woman playing at being vulnerable, seen in a mix of gleaming close-ups and network of shadows that prefigure her journey to gaol. At the centre of this rich mixture are the notions ofindulby Astor and which Bogart guards himself, and doubleness in which the characters can be seen as alternatives of each other. posed

To see how significant change the arrival of film noir was one only has to look at a minor outing like Robert Siodmak's Phantom Lady (1944) The plot is simplicity itself: a man convicted of killing his wife is to be executed in eighteen days. His secretary believes him to be innocent andsets about proving him to be so by finding the missing lady who can supply him with an alibi. She does so and wins his love. What is noteworthy from the outset is that the circumstantial evidence that Alan Curtis is guilty is accompanied by a strong sense that he wanted to kill her; that she deserves to die (she was an affair), and that her murderer (his 'friend Franchot Tone) who is described as being schizophrenic artist, is in a real sense out his repressed desires (which of course is the theme of Hitchcock's 1951 Strangers Train). Having the potential to commit murder or act violently is a common feature of film noir (for Nicholas Ray's In a Lonely Place, 1950). For most of Phantom Lady Curtis is removed from his world, and in the same way Ella Raines spends the whole film discovering another world. Two sequences in particular stand out. In the first she follows possible witness from her world to his, having acting

through gloomy; narrow streets that bring to mind a Greek rather than criminal underworld. The second is even more extreme Posing as a prostitute, Raines goes to a late-night jazz session which climaxes with an orgiastic drum solo, highlighted by   expressionist lighting and dramatic camera angles, which visually confirms the power of sex (and along the way explains why Tone killed Curtis's wife)

The Revolt of Mamie Stover (in colour and CinemaScope) is not really a film noir. Rather it is parody of both the girl (i.e: prostitute) who is deported from San Francisco to Honolulu in 1941 and makes pile of money there through property development (financed by her work in brothelfnight-club) with the US army as her major client\_ When she discovers love in the form of Richard Egan's rich but weak novelist she reforms to prove her love for him before out of loyalty to others returning to work at the Bungalow (as the brothel is euphemistically called) When Egan discovers this he disowns her; she gives him its contrasting worlds, the foregrounding of Russell as a threateningly strong woman, and use of genre locations (the Bungalow night-club), The Revolt of Mamie Stover, despite its many ragged glories, is an impossible film It is quite simply out of time, bowdlerized because of the mores of the time in which it was created, and only intelligible in non-generic terms-as the work of its director, Raoul Walsh. typical

Two films by the veteran director Raoul Walsh highlight how much film noir was grounded in the changes in the patterns of life brought about by the Second World War in America: The Man Love (1946) and The Revolt of Mamie Stover (1956) In the first Ida Lupino is the independent woman (a night-club singer) who while on visit to her sister sorts out her sister's problems, which are mainly caused by the fact that her husband is in a war veterans' hospital suffering from exhaustion The film touches number of the generic elements of the crime film but its central focus is on the contrast between strong woman (Lupino) and a weak man (Bruce Bennett) with a sexual predator (Robert Alda) in the middle. The film is both one ofthe most optimistic films noir; primarily because Walsh focuses (almost) exclusively on Lupino; and also one of the organization of the strong woman versus weak man scenario.

The one thing that is missing from the film is a flashback. The use of flashbacks was to become staple item the effect of progress. Hence the decline of the rise-andfall scenario. By suggesting that looking back; as in that marvellously titled film, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past of the future is forever tarnished.

## DEFINING FANTASY

According to director François Truffaut, the history of the cinema follows two lines of descent, one deriving from Lumière and and the other deriving from Méliès and involving the creation of fantasy. Though the division is historically dubious; it is nevertheless possible to draw a broad distinction between films (and film genres) which operate generally within the confines of verisimilitude events which happen accordto natural   possibilities-and those which defy O extend verisimilitude by portraying events which fall outside natural confines. ing

The types of film which modern audiences would most readily identify as falling into the second category are adventure\_ These are perceived as distinct genres which have in common the fact that each imaginatively conimpossible experiences that defy rational logic and rently known empirical laws. Furthermore, by exploiting the fantastic elements of their narratives and by utilizing and foregrounding range of cinematic practices identified as 'special effects' all three genres   tend to make these worlds and experiences ostentatiously concrete and writes Tom Hutchison (1974), 'is the appalling idea given sudden flesh; science fiction is the improbable made possible within the confines of a technological age And fantasy adventure and romance is the appealing and impossible personal wish concretely and objectively fulfilled .

More if not all, are in some respect fantasies, in that produce illusions based on the manipulation of an original pro-filmic event by various forms of photographic and montage effect. Fantasy genres, therefore, represent characteristic of cinema as a whole. Certainly much early cinema was reflexively fascinated by its own 'fantastic' subversion of the physical laws of space-time and causality to which spectators were subjected. It recognized the medium's inherent illusionism and 'trickality' , first in plotless displays ofcinematic magicand then in narratives native spatio-temporal frameworks and impossible to the Moon (1902) enacts the transformation of the cinema as an impossible world constituted by special effects into cinema about impossible worlds with special properties. It was only later that the cinema's ontological trickality was displaced into fantastic narratives and commercially exploited in the genres   to which the name fantasy is attached Meanwhile in the more ordinary run of films (which often employ many of the same artificial studio techniques as their   fantasy counterparts) the trick element is suppressed and artifice is concealed as nature\_ they Trip

It is worth asking, in this context, why certain other types of film in which non-naturalistic elements are prebiblical epics for example-are not generally included in is quite revealing about the way the cinema operates ,

## THE FANTASTIC

and the role of the concept of genre in setting audience expectations

In the case of avant-garde and experimental film, one reason is institutional. Individual and independently made films stand outside the arena of commercial studio production and so do not fit in with the development of shorthand ofgenre conventions shared by producers and consumers. as 'high' rather than popular culture and the points of reference for understanding them are art movements like Expressionism Or Surrealism rather than other film The fantastic worlds and events created in his films by French poet and artist Jean Cocteau are therefore assimilated to the fantasy genre only when, as in La Belle et la Bête (1946), there are additional cues clearly aligning the film with pre existing non-film genre such fairy-tale. More significantly, however; avantgarde films tend, much as early film did, to concentrate less on cre ating fantasy worlds and events in the cinema than on reflexively directing spectators back to the allembracing

The animated film is also excluded from the genres that constitute fantasy-unless, like Gulliver's Travels (1939) it also draws upon material previously associated with those Fantasy adventures such as King Kong (1933) and cial effects of model animation, but they do so in the context ofa three dimensional world which is enough like our own or at least constant enough in the rules governing its magic for the figure of a prehistoric beast or an army of skeletons to be perceived by characters and audience alike as and 'special'\_ anything can defy empirical norms, whereas the fantasy film proper starts from an initial realism which is then violated when the monster emerges or the dead come to life or the space-time traveller enters a different world of the created world and the 'special' effects which bring them to visibility would which their fantastic qualities and their specialness could be figured. genres have

Although there have been extremely popular fantasy musicals such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Mary Poppins (1964), musicals in general are not fantasies People do not, of course, go about the world breaking into song and dance on continual basis, nor does an unseen orchestra accompany them when do. In this respect, however, the world of the musical is an impossible one, but not-in the sense in which the word is used here~a fantastic one For the spectacular effects of the musical remain grounded in while the emotions of the their expressivity is heightened, remain engaged with normal situations\_ The musical they

privileges conventional human emotion and extraordinary   physical achievement rather than fantastic events and specially marked cinematic 'effects' that transgress the boundaries of quotidian human experience

The biblical epic also merits mention, since it is genre which does   often foreground characters who and it uses effects to figure the 'miraculous" event. Samson's superhuman strength down the temple in Samson and Delilah (1949) and Moses visibly the Red Sea in The Ten Commandments (1956), and these special events are concretized and figured within the context of an empirically credible (though not always historically accurate) world\_ None the less, these kinds of films are also not considered fantasies. It is not just their content as different, since horror films often overtly borrow from religious and spiritualdiscourse, and fantasy films (however secular their inflection) often figure the Devil or angels among their characters. Dominant tradition in Western culture however, marks a difference here between the 'fantastic' and the 'miraculous Biblical narratives tend to ambiguous about the empirical basis for their miracles , and special events and specialeffects are ambiguously perceived . are represented and taken up as both historical fact and pure   allegory, but almost never as which is special brings parts They

## HORROR, SCIENCE FICTION, FANTASY ADVENTURE

In the United States and Great Britain, then, the delimited, produced, advertised, and popularly consumed as fantasy films are relatively few: horror; science fiction and fantasy adventure (which includes fantasy romance) The boundaries between them are extremely permeable, and Sea an SF or fantasy adventure?). But each of the three has a certain distinct 'core' identity relative to the others , and although reductive and open to exception and argument, it is none the less useful to to their differences\_ genres they genres point

Thematically; while all three genres are bound by their concern with the limitations of what passes for empirical fact and the possibilities of acquiring knowledge that exceeds the boundaries of what is taken as the factual the horror film ofthe studio years generally characterized this desire to move beyond the known as transgressive 'There are some things that resonates throughout the genre, and whose trespass is the driving force behind its narratives.

sanguinely; the genre's drive into the 'unknown' ischaracterized by bold epistemological curiosity and its limited satisfaction, andis fuelled by an 'infinite' and 'progressive deferral of any final satisfaction. Thus, the slogan of the television series Star Trek, 'To boldly go where no man has gone before' resonates with empirical and technological optimism and openness that ultimately over rides any underlying trepidation. The fantasy adventure exceeds the limits with another alternative. The genre is less about transgressing the natural down by man's empirical knowledge (as is horror), or about extrapolating and extending those boundaries (as is SF) , than it is about superseding them. Fantasy narratives are driven by the act of wishing; magic and the magical event are its fuel, and wish fulfilment both its interim problem and its happy solution. yet

Distinguishing the genres in their thematic relation to epistemological concerns and their narrative drives, we the fantasy film suspends it. In releasing and suppressing those monsters who emerge as our doubles and alter egos the horror film recognizes that the congruence of our empirical knowledge and our personal desire is impossible to achieve and that possibility of the congruence of empirical knowledge and personal desire but it also achieves and realizes it The the world of magic and wish. And the SF film, as the most realistic and empirically based of the three genres , sees the congruenceofempirical knowledge and personal desire as possible, but recognizes that its achievement is always partial and dependent upon the progressive development of technologies as well as upon the rationality of personal desire

Horror seems the most organic of the three genres; its focus tends to equate irrationality with the bestial and with the dissolution; decay; and deformation of human bodies (although in its late studio years and after, horror became   less overtly about bodily transformation and focused more on psychological transformation). In classic protagonists were split in two and the genre foregrounded areversible preoccupation with the beast in man and man in the beast With its focus on the dissolution of bodies and psyches, the horror film is about the unmaking of worlds and identities The SF film is the logically focused of the three and it is reversibly preoccupied with the ghost in the machine and the machine in the Its manifestations of artificial" and 'alien' intelligence such as Robby the Robot in Forbidden Planet (1956) Or the high-foreheaded Metalunans of This Island

Earth (1954) offer us technologized bodies that, during the threat of an appealing yet heartless rationality. Even the genre's awakening and mutation of organic (and often primeval) With its emphasis on the founding of new worlds and the construction of new technologies, the SF film is about most pre occupied with the nature of will and the will of nature, this reversibility creating visible correspondences between the physical world and the personal world, and presenting us with classical, idealized human bodies that, (1924) or tornado as in The Wizard of Oz (1939), or through the sheer force of love as in Portrait of Jennie (1948) or Pandora and the Flying Dutchman (1951). In the ease with which it uses cinematic magic to transport and transform human thefantasy film is about character-making: Indeed, it literalizes the Bildungsroman and is often structured around tests of character and action that transcend the division of experience into physical and spiritual. beings,

The poetic project ofhorror; SF, and fantasy is to imagine and to make visible to us, within the context of narrative and certain normative realism, those worlds and that escape the constraints of our current empirical knowour most fearful nightmares, utopian dreams, and wilful wishes. Horror, SF, and fantasy films are all concerned with the limits of knowledge and with the imaginative making, unmaking, and remaking of worlds and human identities. Thus, all tell stories about and give concrete and visible form to that which is not concrete and visible in our daily existence and under our historical and cultural conditions of knowledge, but which, nevertheless, we feel is there. The horror film of the studio years gives physical and to metaphysical notions of spirit or moral evil: the created monster in beings shape

The three genres also differ in the mode in which engage the spectator. Each often appeals to a different sort of audience or to a different aspect of each ofits audience members. The horror film primarily engages us affectively and viscerally\_its aim seems to be to scare and disgust us, our eyes. Fantasy films tend to engage us cognitively and kinetically\_that is, to make us aware of human effort and motion. And the SF film tends to engage uS cognitively and visually-to make thoughtful and to evoke our wonder. Whatever their differences, however; all three fantasy genres share common project that was consolidated to the present day: This project is simultaneously poetic, cultural (or ideological) and industrial (or commercial).

Frankenstein represents an inchoate and incoherent sub jectivity that is visibly realized in the 'crazy quilt' patchwork of his visibly stitched-together body. The SF film concretizes the unseen space and time of the past and future: the prehistoric past, for example, imagined and realized by the supple model animation of dinosaurs in The Lost World (1925), and the unknown future by the visible outer space and cracked lunar surface in Destínation Moon (1950). And the fantasy adventure makes visible to us and tangible to its characters intangible desires and transformations of character: thus, the literalization of the desire for eternal life, love, and power in She (1935, 1965), the actual realization of wish and will in The Man who Could Work Miracles  (1937), the concrete relations between a visible human Picture of Dorian being Gray

During the studio years (as well as after) , the common industrial project of all fantasy films was, of course, to produce commercially profitable product. Rick Altman suggests above that the establishment of a successful and relatively stable generic form (or syntax) is dependent audience's ritual values and the industry's ideological commitments' and upon 'accommodating audience desires to studio concerns' . For all three established

Horror; SF, and fantasy films, then, attempt to imagine and literally to picture what escapes personal, social, and institutional knowledge, control and visibility and, through making the invisible visible; to name, contain and controlit. This containment is their common cultural the recognition of and desire for something potentially limitless and transformative outside the bounds of present existence, and on the other, the need for social control, perinstitutional protection against that which is limitless and transformative Thus, while the genres of horror; SF, and fantasy adventure all challenge the   premisses for empirical knowledge and notion of reality; they almost all conservatively maintain and promote these laws and practices to measure of personal and social safety, certainty, and stab ility at their end. Furthermore, in most paradoxical way; almost all fantasy films promote (even when they challenge) the conservation and maintenanceof theideology of the Enlightenment and the positivist empirical the project of fantasy in the cinema is to transform immaterial and subjective phenomena and qualities into realize it. This cultural privileging of objectivity; of the physically concrete; and ofvision as a way of knowing the world corresponds closely with the technological nature and commercial goals of cinema as an industry.

fantasy genres, the common ground that links audience desire (to see the unseeable) with studio concerns (to sell movies) is their general dependence upon special effects Through effects that draw upon the latest in new techniques (of make-up for example) and new technologies (computer imaging, for example) so as to remain 'special' , horror, SF, and fantasy genres are able to fulfil the audience's desire that the invisible become visible at the same time are able to fulfil the industry's ideological commitment to maintain audience desire for the cinema itself. In the fantasy genres, imagination tends to mean they

## ORIGINS AND INFLUENCES

Like most other film genres, fantasy films are part of a rich history that extends itself well before and beyond cinema into folk-tale; fairy-tale; myth, legend, chivalric as genres-as well as their cultural uses-are inflected by historical particularity and national specificity.

Thus, the horror film of the studio years was a crystallization of influences that included east European folktales about vampires and werewolves and Caribbean tales about zombies; literary works such as Goethe's Faust, Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Robert Louis Stevenson's the mid-1920s onwards from

These influences were absorbed and developed in various ways, depending on the economic opportunities available On the whole in the 1930s and 1940s the four Hollywood studios-Paramount, MGM, 2Oth Century Fox and Warners-eschewed the horror genre, leaving market niche for their competitors to exploit. In the 1930s it was Universal who pioneered horror as a low-cost studio genre with Tod Browning's Dracula (1931), starring Bela Lugosi in the title-role, and Frankenstein (1931), directed by Whale also made The Old Dark House (1933) and Bride of Frankenstein which carried the genre forward with Cat People (1942), and I Walked with a Zombie (1943), both directed by Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson's Isle of the Dead (1945), and others. A similar role was played in Britain by Hammer Films in the late 1950s and early 1960s, drawing upon the talents of Terence Fisher for The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), Horror top

economic chaos and, consequently, of national ceptibility to Fascism during the Weimar years. It also seems hardly accidental that a particularly large number offantasy romances were made in both America and Great Britain immediately before and after the Second World War-many of them like Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941), A Named Joe (1943), and A Matter of Life and Death (1946; US title: Stairway to Heaven) about men who have died getting second 'fantastic' chance to resolve the moral and emotional dilemmas they left behind them.

and which were therefore 'pre-sold' . But the popularity of Hammer's revivals of Frankenstein, Dracula, and werewolves had a lot to do with censorship practices at the time The containment provided by literary tradition, generic convention, and period costume allowed Hammer's Gothic horror films to exploit eroticism and sadism beyond what was generally acceptable in more realistic genres .

Fantasy elements also inform Latin American and Mexican cinemas in tradition that has only lately crystallized into 'magical realism ~a generic grouping by its relationship to contemporary Hispanic literature, its normalization of the fantastic within texts\_ A contemporary example in Mexican cinema is the popular Like Water for Hot Chocolate (Como agua para chocolate, 1991) directed by Alonso Arau, but there were earlier works of magical realism such as Roberto Gavaldón's Macario (1959) about poor woodsman who makes a pact with Death, and The Golden Cock (El de oro, 1964), critique of both poverty and greed.

## ENGAGING WITH REALITY

<!-- image -->

The Depression and the arrival ofsynchronized sound had profound impact on documentary film practices . The modernist aesthetic that had characterized the important documentary work of the 1920s gave way to a new emphasis on social, economic; and political concerns. This shift is symbolized by the career ofJoris Ivens, who made short, aesthetically innovative documentaries in the 1920s and politically committed works such as Borinage (1933) about the oppressive living conditions of miners in Belgium. While documentaries of the 1930s often challenged the policies and politics of established governments, many film-makers in the west and in Japan developed new ties with governments during the decade; often to make films advocating progressive  goals. These ties were further developed during the Second World War; as documentary played a crucial propaganda role on both sides of the conflict. During the 1930s and 1940s documentary increasingly became a form that reached and influenced mass audiences for purposes beyond entertainment or art.

The shift from live audio accompaniment to recorded making, though there were some early and important exceptions. Warner Bros. used the Vitaphone to film vaudeville acts in 1926-short subjects that had documentary value but were soon interpolated into larger fictional appeared in 1927, using synchronous recorded sound to film events such as the departure of Charles Lindbergh. As the mainstream industry switched over to synchronous were sometimes acquired by aspiring documentary filmsound meant that documentary film-makers  reapplied thebasicformat andtechniques ofthe illustrated lecture narration; music, and sound effects laid over images shot with a silent camera. Recorded sound allowed not only for greater standardization but also for greater precision and complexity in linking image and sound. Innovative filmmakers like Alberto Cavalcanti pushed these new bilities in experimental directions Moreover; in the 1930s a few film programmes initially presented with live narration music had synchronized   sound-track possi-

## THE COLONIALIST ADVENTURER AND TRAVELLER

The explorer-adventure-travelogue genre remained highly popular throughout the 1930s. A theme running through manyof these was the challenging but triumphant deployment of western technologies in underdeveloped or inaccessible areas With Byrd at the South Pole (1930) traced the Everest Flight (1933), an illustrated lecture by Air Commo dore P.F. M. Fellows, depicted 'the official story of man's Conquest by Air of one of the last of the world's explored areas Osa and Martin Johnson released Congorilla (1932), which included few scenes among pygmies of the Belgian Congo (Zaïre) shot with synchronized sound.

With African adventure traditionally seen as dangerous and primitive, the presence of the diminutive and attractive Osa added a new was added to the homosocial world of male adventure changing the dynamic.

His party of travellers feel no responsibility for rather glory in and sometimes add to them. The film's spectator is forced to take an active role in analysing the film and interpreting the images and facts provided, and in the process Buñuel implicitly encourages viewers to assume a more critical stance when seeing other documentaries (like La Croisière jaune) in the same genre

Other documentarians of the time expressed an ethnographic impulse by moving away the illustrated lecture and looking toward the sync-sound fiction film as model. Palos bruderfærd (The Wedding of Palo; 1934) Danish film made by anthropologist Knud Rasmussen and Frederich Dalsheim, was shot along the coast of eastern Greenland and employed Inuit dialogue: story of Palo who courts Navarana and finally wins her away from his rival, Samo, and her family; who are reluc(1934) is a highly romanticized look at the Aran islanders who live off the coast of Ireland.

The foremost practitioner of the social issue documentary, one fiction film-making in Great Britain and eventually throughout much of the world was John Grierson. Grierson had worked briefly as a film critic in the United States, where he condemned most Hollywood product in vehement terms. Looking for alternatives, he found them in the work of Robert Flaherty; which he applauded for its 'documentary' qualities-thus coining a phrase (or atleast popularizing a term which had been used intermittently and with little descriptive force) Grierson returned to 1927 and became Assistant Film Officer for the Empire Marketing Board, quasi-governusing his knowledge of American and Soviet film, he made Drifters, fifty-eight-minute silent documentary about the fishing process . pol

Dozens of other short films were made by the British documentary film movement in the 1930s. Spare Time (1939), Humphrey Jennings's first important film, stands out for its class leisure activities. And its style, the juxtaposition of only loosely related sounds and images, looks towards his later work.

Lorentz, whose involvement in film also began when he was a reviewer for New York-based newspapers and periodicals. Lorentz called cinema the still-born art' , railed alternatives to mainstream Hollywood film-making A vocal advocate of Presi 1935 by Rexford Tugwell, of the recently created Resettle ment Administration, to make The Plow that Broke the Plains (1936) and The River (1937). Although the United States government had produced numerous documentaries of modest ambition and non-controversial content since the First World War, Lorentz's efforts were different. The Plow that Broke the Plains traces the history of farming in the Great Plains, pointing to various environmental abuses The film culminates with powerful images of the dust storms of Oklahoma and surrounding areas. The Plow that Broke  the Plains was widely praised for illuminating problem ofnational importance, but in that election year politicians and influential citizens from the depicted areas saw the documentary as New Deal propaganda that exaggerated the devastation A coda, which showed how the government was resettling farmers from marginal land, was ultimately dropped, so the film presented disaster without any likely solution. The River   reprised many of the themes of The Plow that Broke the Plains. By abusing theland through deforestation and poor farming, Americans had prospered, but were now paying the price, as a generation grew up in the Mississippi Valley 'illclad, Van Dyke and Floyd Crosby; filmed the devastating floods of 1937, giving the film timely and spectacular The government, however; was beginning to put the valley together through such projects as the dams being built by the Tennessee Valley Authority Both films lacked punch. again

established the US Film Service, headed by Lorentz, which was designed to make films for the various departments of the US government. Lorentz started on the never-finished Ecce Homo about unemployment, then switched his mortality and maternity risks associated with unsanitary conditions in poor urban neighbourhoods. This used pro fessional actors in several roles, though most of the film was shot on location. With Lorentz working on The Fight for Life, the Film Service hired Joris Ivens to make Power and the Land (1940), about the transforming impact of electrification for farmers who frequently had to rely on the government rather than private utility companies for It also hired Robert Flaherty to make The Land (1941), a controversial look at man's abuse of the land and the efforts of the Department of Agriculture to manage resources to reduce poverty. The US Film Service lost its authorization in 1940 and the organization. key

Despite numerous parallels, there were significant dif ferences between the Grierson group and the one assembled by Lorentz. The Second World War rescued the GPO Film Unit (renamed Crown Film Unit) in Great Britain, even as it assured the end of the US Film Service in the United States. Grierson's organization made many more films, most of which were less ambitious than those that Lorentz produced. Grierson trained generation of British documentarians while Lorentz consistently hired comparatively   experienced film-makers , already well developed in their methods and achievements (Strand\_ to be producer-director-writer, rather than act as a civil servant, while his films dealt with social and economic problems with a forthright; admittedly 'New Deal' stance. Perhaps because Great Britain was often led by a coalition government in the 1930s, the Empire Marketing Board and the GPO made less obviously controversial documentaries: were service efforts rather than advo cacy. Yet Grierson's legacy was unquestionably more influential over the longer term. Lorentz ceased to be presence in American documentary film after 1940, while Grierson not only established the National Film Board of Canada, after his move there in 1939, but became legendary figure in Anglo-American film-making circles. public public they

Within both Great Britain and the United States there was a substantial amount of documentary production that addressed economic and social issues from leftstandpoint. The Workers' Film and Photo League was active in both countries. In the United States, this group as Unemployment Special (1931) and The National Hunger March (1931), as well as short political documentaries, such as On the Waterfront (Leo Seltzer and Leo Hurwitz, 1934). The organization provided training ground for American film-makers in similar way to the Empire Marketing Board and the GPO Unit in Britain. Its members left in the mid-1930s Contemporary Films Frontier Paul Strand produced The Wave (Redes; 1935) with script by Henwar made in Mexico, tells the story of poor fishermen who struggle to improve their economic situation.

## PROPAGANDA IN THE SHADOW OF WORLD

The rise of Leni Riefenstahl and the demise of Dziga Vertov reveal much about documentary in continental Europe during the 1930s. The Soviet Union didnot produceits first sync-sound documentaries until 1931, when Ilya Kopalin directed One of showing everyday activities on collective near Moscow with location sound, and Many, farm

Vertov produced Enthusiasm: Symphony of the Donbas; with The latter was modernist ode to industrialization, which functioned within the city symphony   genre. While film, Three Songs of Lenin (1934), a more restrained lyrical detailing of the ways in which Lenin was remembered. But Vertov was an increasingly isolated figure, and Soviet documentary became less and less adventurous as the decade progressed.

If there are disturbing similarities between Iriumph of fenstahl's film is ultimately political propaganda of different orderone for racial purification not the (admittedly selective) homo genization of the melting-pot. The past and its problems are meant to function only as an effective counterpoint to the present with its mass of anonymous, sieg-heiling Germans attending the rally.

In the process , Hitler and the various troops are eroticized by Riefenstahl's adoring vision. Her using They

Although German film-makers produced hundreds of documentaries which avoided overt Nazi   propaganda during the 1930s, Hitler's assumption of power in Feb ruary 1933 made left-wing film-making impossible The foremost German film-maker of this period was Leni Riefenstahl, an actress and fiction film director who turned to documentary production after Hitler asked her to film the 1933 Nazi in Nuremberg (Sieg des Glaubens and made a similar, but more ambitious, film of the 1934 Triumph of the Will (Triumph des Willens, 1935), which shares certain methods and concerns with English and of the autobahns and the state's efforts to put people back to work are referred to in speeches by Nazi Party leaders.

Hitler appointed Riefenstahl to direct a film on the 1936 summer Olympics, resulting in the two-part documentary Olympia (1938). This monumental effort was financed by the Propaganda Ministry headed by Joseph Goebbels; and served the immediate goals of the Reich, then seeking to convince the world that it was interested in furthering international peace and governing Germany in an atmosphere of calm, order; and national purpose

Political documentary in France followed a very different pattern. After a slow start, the breakthrough came film produced for the French Communist Party in early 1936. Written and directed by a loose collective of filmmakers headed by Jean Renoir and including Jean-Paul Le Chanois, Pierre Unik, and Jacques Becker, it combines acted and scripted sequences with stock footage and other non-fiction materials. This syncretic form falls loosely if somewhat uneasily within the parameters of the documentary genre of this period. The making of La Vie est à nous led to the formation of Ciné-Liberté, an independent production company affiliated with the Popular Front which won the French election that April Among its first films ('Strikes and occupations' , 1936), which traced the success of labour strikes in the first weeks of the Popular Front government.

When civil war erupted in Spain, the country's filmmakers turned to non-fiction film-making in large numbers. Many films were made on the republican side with Luis Buñuel and Pierre Unik producing España 1936 (released in 1937 in both Spanish and French versions) The film, made through Ciné-Liberté in Paris, was shaped by Buñuel's surrealist sensibility: brutal and banal images ofthe war are tied together by a commentary that refuses easy  sloganizing and optimistic rhetoric\_ Meanwhile Helen van Dongen, then in New York with Joris Ivens, was asked to edit footage of the Civil War into a compilation documentary\_Spain in Flames (1937). Frustrated by the lack of footage from the loyalist side, Ivens found financing that enabled him to travel to Spain and make Spanish Earth It depicts the defence of Madrid and its environs; includwhere an irrigation project is making the land newly productive. Heart of Spain (1937) was also shot in Spain, by Hungarian photographer Géza Karpathi and the American journalist Herbert Kline, and then assembled in New York by Kline, Paul Strand, and Leo Hurwitz.

The Japanese invasion of Manchuria also attracted the attention of film-makers from many countries . China Yan'an after the Long March, and John Ferno and Joris lvens's Four Hundred Million (1939) presented gruesome footage of the Japanese offensive. After filming the Spanish Civil War, Roman Karmen also travelled to China, where he filmed Mao; resulting in the series of short films China in Battle (1938-9) and the feature documentary In Mao were able to make twentyone short non-fiction films between 1939 and 1945, most notably Yenan and the Eighth Route Army (1939), directed by Yuan Mu-jih. Japanese filmmakers also produced documentaries of the war; includFumio Kamei's Shanhai (Shanghai, 1937), a feature made for Tohoin which 'talking heads' ofJapanese officers astation Hirano, Kamei's next film, Tatakau heitai ('Soldiers at the front' 1938), which focused on the physical exhaustion of the soldiers rather than their bravery in combat, was nicknamed 'Tsukareta heitai' (soldiers in exhaustion) The film was banned, and Kamei was imprisoned.

## THE SECOND WORLD WAR

With World War, documentary assumed a crucial propagandistic role-to instil domestic audiences with the will to persevere and win, and to shape perceptions at home as well as in Allied and neutral countries Most wartime documentaries were made under the direct control of governments, but in occupied countries such as Denmark and France film-makers engaged in surreptitious filming and screening of non-fiction materials as acts of potent defiance. In Germany; newsreels were filled with footage gathered from the battle fronts, and, in addition, the Reich Propaganda Ministry produced many wartime mentaries.

After Japan attacked Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941), the US government mobilized rapidly for war and began to produce numerous documentaries through the Army other organizations.

## POST-WAR DOCUMENTARY

After the war, documentary entered a crisis, which lasted almost fifteen years\_ The decline transcended region and politics but the general causes were often buttressed by circumstances specific to individual national cinemas . Documentary had become too closely associated with its wartime role as propaganda; its polemical stance was now considered anathema. Documentary, moreover; had traditionally been an alternative practice; in the post-war period television offered employment for those unwilling or unable to work in the feature film industry. (In the United States there were early non-fiction television series suchas Edward R. Murrow's See It Now and Robert Saudek's Omnibus ) Documentarians of the continued to dominate the field but for a variety of personal and instiof their pre-war work.

British documentary faced a crisis in the immediate post-war era The Labour government elected in 1945 seemed to many to be the realization of what they had polemical edge. Jennings's Family Portrait (1951) affirms British identity and purpose by evoking the nation's great men even as it hails the multifaceted qualities of the islands' average, contemporary citizens.

Renewal was embodied by the Free Cinema' , a term coined by young film-maker and critic Lindsay Anderson who subsequently employed it as a proEngland and abroad.

These documentaries refused abstraction and took a more observational style, one more attentive to individual personality and chology (the film-maker's as well as the subjects') Every day day.

In the post-war period the French government routinely subsidized shorts, particularly documentaries , as a way of 'rebuilding national cinema; a law prohibiting the screening of double bills then helped ensure the films theatrical release These productions , which served as training ground for aspiring directors, were often significant in their own right.

From a conventional western perspective, these various interventions into; and departures from, the working of a mainly capitalist industry can be seen as exceptions to presumed norm, provoked by exceptional circumstances and for the most part marginal to the main development of the cinema. Such perspective is broadly valid for the cinemas of pluralist; capitalist countries; in periods of

parts of the world where the western capitalist norm does not have the status of normality; its validity is not so self: evident. In particular the idea of and world of politics and into which governments are forced to intervene needs to be put into question\_ For many situations, a perspective has to be adopted for which politics is not incidental but central, and the tension between social and political systems, cultures and world-views, is seen as major determinant ofthe form cinema could take.

In its early years-up to the end of the First World War the cinema  conformed  broadly to the perTucker's Traffic in Souls (1913)its monopoly practices began to be scrutinized by the courts in the course of the battles waged by Thomas Edison against his competitors throughout the first decade of the century; and, during the World War; governments intervened to regulate news reporting from the front and to encourage patriotic film-making at home. But whereas, by rights, the Armisticeof 1918 should have signalled the end of a state ofexception and a return to a previously experienced normality; in fact it ushered in a condition of crisis which has affected the cinema ever since. Crisis and conflict became the norm, even if their effects were not always and everywhere apparent.

## REVOLUTION

establishment in Hungary in April 1919 of the short-lived

Republic of the Councils (also known as the 'Béla Kun soviet') one of whose acts was council, Or 'soviet', charged with carrying out this nationalization included among its personnel the perhaps unlikely names of Sándor (later Sir Alexander) Korda and Béla Blaskó (later Bela Lugosi) (Legend also has it that alias Michael Austria, where he was working; to take part in the moveKun soviet lasted only four months; it was overthrown in August 1919 and in the repression that followed many of its leaders and supporters-including Kun himself; the exile. But in the same year, the Russian revolutionary government, concerned at the emigration offilm industry personnel and the loss of equipment; also acted to nationalize its film studios and to bring film-making generally control. This was to have consequences which lasted until 1990 and beyond

The impact of the measures taken in Russia (and soon applied throughout the whole of the new Soviet Union) was in fact far greater than was intended or could have been predicted. The purpose was principally to bring the material side of the industry under control, with a view to its eventual integration into a socialist economy. Meanwhile attempts were made in parallel to harness the activities of artists in the service of the Revolution. It would appear too that the early concerns of Lenin and Lunwere above all educational Lenin's much-quoted state ment, 'For us the cinema is the most important of all the arts, referred principally to its potential for spreading knowledge and socialist ideas to thelargely illiterate population of the Soviet Union, rather than to its status within culture.

The new film culture in the Soviet Union was at first continued to be imported; Fairbanks and Pickford visited Moscow in 1926, to acclaim Foreign styles were imitated. Then, from the mid-1920s distinctively 'Ruswhich, although not conspicuously with audiences at home, The consolidation of the Stalinist regime at the end of the decade together with the coming of the dialogue film at about the same time, enforced the abandonment of montage cinema in feature film production and its replacement in importing of foreign flms dried up to But in the mean time networks had been set up in the west, supported by the Communist parties and sympathizing intellectuals, which promoted the original Soviet model in avant-garde circles , from which it spread outwards into great popular

documentary and (to a lesser extent) feature film practice As the Soviet Union withdrew into itself, beleaguered and boycotted by the west and increasingly repressive towards its own people; left-wing intellectuals in western countries promoted an idea of film culture which drew its aesthetic and   political   inspiration from an idealized notion of Soviet experience and achievement.

What was happening in the Soviet Union was followed with anxiety throughout the west. The American industry was concerned mainly with the loss of a lucrative market at the spread of Communist ideas and used various cento restrict the public showing of Russian films As might be expected, these restrictions were only partially effective and were sometimes counterproductive. Eisenstein's The Battleship Potemkin was greeted with enormous enthusiasm when it was shown in London same year Eisenstein and Pudovkin visited London and Eisenstein also attended the conference of avant-garde links were maintained between 'approved' Soviet artists and western sympathizers   throughout the 1920s and

Control of the cinema by the Communist Party and by the State (the two were not always easy to distinguish) steadily increased throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In the early years the authorities relied to a large extent on the political commitment and enthusiasm of film-makers to produce films in conformity with revolutionary ideals. As in literature, different schools of thought contended, and produced different results. But with the consolidation of under Stalin at the end of the 1920s, this changed\_ The industry became more tightly organized, and deviant ideas began to be suppressed. power

## FASCISM

Not all governments were universally hostile to the Soviet in 1922, Mussolini echoed Lenin in proclaiming that 'the cinema is the most powerful weapon' In 1926 the government nationalized the production of newsreels and documentaries.   making them an arm of the State for propaganda purposes. The Russian cinema was also much admired by some of the more committed Fascists among Italian film-makers-for example Alessandro Blasetti, whose Sole ('Sun', 1929) shows a clear influence of Pudovkin and other masters of the Russian silent cinema. The ideas of Eisenstein and Pudovkin were taken up by film intellectuals such as Luigi Chiarini and Umberto Barbaro and came, by roundabout route, to influence the war neo-realist generation of film-makers . But, despite their claims to be creating a 'totalitarian' State, the Fascists intervened very little in the entertainment cinema, post -

regarding it (mistakenly) as neither culturally nor politically important Government intervention was in the first instance economic rather than cultural. It aimed to shore up crumbling industry and encouraged the making of films which could compete with Hollywood at were mainly negative, and took the form of censorship and the  discouragement of anti-national Even during the Second World War; when the industry was put on footing; few films were unequivocally Fascist (as distinct from nationalistic) in their approach\_

An even greater negativity marked the cultural policies Whereas in encouraged the and allowed it measure of freedom provided it was not overtly critical of ment and the Catholic Church was actively hostile to the cinema. After the defeat ofthe Republic in 1939,all radical voices in the Spanish cinema were silenced who had made documentaries republicans , fled the country along with many other artists\_ A severe censorship was instituted , in moral and religious matters even more than political, and the Spanish cinema; which during the early 1930s had been thriving industry with vigorous export trade with Latin America, entered into period of inertia from which it did not emerge until the mid-1950s great for

Far more dramatic were events in Germany. At the a dominant position in European cinema. It also had a vital left-wing culture, which produced its own films outside the main-stream\_ The Social Democrats and, in competition with them the Communists attempted to set up alternative cultural networks during the Weimar Republic; with their Out of this background came films like Piel Jutzi's 1931 film adaptation of Alfred Döblin's famous novel BerlinAlexanderplatz and Slatan Dudow and Bertolt Brecht's Kuhle Wampe (1932). The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 brought a brutal end to this cultural activity The Nazis set up their own cinema institutions, availing themselves in a debased form of Russian models. Meanwhile left-wing and Jewish film-makers went into exile; fleeing to France; Denmark, Britain, OI Switzerland. From went on to Hollywood where joined an earlier wave of émigrés \_ Of the film industry personnel who remained behind in Germany, several were to die in concentration camps. No Jews were safe, but a number of other anti-Nazi artists and technicians survived, working relatively uncompromised in the entertainment sector of the industry. they

It could perhaps be argued that the biggest effect that Nazism lie in the films that were produced in Germany and the other Fascist countries so much as in the emigration they

produced, in 1933 and then in 1940. The silent cinema had been international, but in the early sound years cinema had shown signs behind ative personnel into exile, Germany hurt its own cinema and those of the countries it occupied during the war, exiles. again

The roll-call of exiles includes the distinguished names Litvak; actors Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt; producer Erich Pommer; cinematographer Eugen Schüfftan. Among those who had already left, whether for career reasons or for fear of persecution to come, were Ernst Lubitsch Murnau, Billy Wilder, and Alfred Junge from Germany, Those who went into temporary or permanent exile from other European countries threatened by Fascism include during the war years, Jean Renoir and René Clair.

## RESURGENT NATIONALISM AND THE POPULAR FRONTS

The rise of Fascism and the exaggerated nationalism of the 1930s also had economic effects on the cinema. In the 1920s number of European countries had acted, somewhat belatedly; to stem the tide of   Hollywood imports through some form of protectionist legislation. They had also begun to forge economic links among themselves , leading in the early sound period to the making of a number of multilingual productions in which the same script was shot on the same set, often with the same director, but with different actors for different language versions. Multilinguals were made all over Europe, mostly by European companies acting in concert; but also by the A major incentive to make them disappeared with the introduction of dubbing, which meant that it was no longer As multilingual production was phased out; national industries retreated again within their own borders. But it was political diffidence that led to a steady decline in co-operFrance on the other. Meanwhile calls for   protection American imports grew stronger and Hollywood was forced to adapt to steady erosion of its European markets . Germany; which in the 1920s had pioneered the 'contingent' system of limiting imports, closed its market deringly; followed suit: proposal to nationalize the distribution companies   responsible for importing films provoked the withdrawal of the Hollywood majors from the Italian market, and with the outbreak of war all importing of American films came to an end. In France where the Loi Marchandeau of 1936 had imposed a more or less voluntary limit on imports, German occupation in 1940 brought all trade with America to an end, as well as driving many artists into exile. against

Meanwhile major ideological shift was place in Europe, which affected both politics and culture and the relationship between them. The 1920s-the Jazz Age had been period of optimism and of a widespread itical indifference, but also of extremism ofvarious kinds , in both politics and art. Modernist experiment flourished, and realism was out of favour. A number of avant-garde artists attached themselves to far-left and far-right itical movements: the Italian futurists to Fascism\_ the Russian futurists and constructivists to the Revolution, taking polpol-

the ideological impact of the avant-garde did not come through its association with political movements (which greeted the artists with caution, to say the least), but through thecontinuing shock waves that modern art gave to the hallowed certainties of what art was supposed to be. These shock waves were felt more in traditional 'high art' than in new popular forms, such as the cinema, which were also modern, but in a different, less frenetically selfconscious way.

The 1930s brought a dramatic change on number of fronts An immediate cause was the Depression which an increasing toll as the decade wore on in continuing more significant in its effects was the realignment of the left in response to the rise of Fascism and the consequent formation of the Popular Fronts\_ In the late 1920s, the international Communist movement, under Soviet leadership, had adopted a hostile position towards the rest of the left, but by 1934 it had begun, belatedly, to repair the breach. Not only were the Communist parties encouraged to seek alliances with the Socialists and other left-wing parties, but Communist artists and intellectuals were persuaded to take up more conciliatory attitude towards their 'bourgeois' counterparts . The doctrine of Socialist Realism, whose brutal imposition did so much harm to sented to the west in watered down form as way of rallying left-wing artists behind the banner of a socially responsible art relatively conventional aesthetic and expressive means \_ using

It was in Spain, where the left was engaged in a desperate struggle to defend the Republic against the invadforces of General Franco, that the ideology and practice of the Popular Front was put to its severest test. ing

Meanwhile it was in France that the new frontist alliance had the most effectiveness, culturally as well as politically. A Popular Front government was formed in 1936, under the leadership of the Socialist Léon Blum (later; in 1946, Blum was to lead delegation to Washington to negotiate various agreements, including one to safeguard the French film industry). The Front polarized existed and were to be further deepened under the Occuof 1940. Whereas in the 1920s the political character of the French cinema had been muted and it made little sense to divide film-makers into left and right, from some, such as veteran avant-gardists Marcel LHerbier and Abel Gance; chose the right, many chose the left, joining already committed intellectuals such as Paul Nizan in support of the Front. Nizan himself wrote the script of André Vigneau's documentary Visages de la France ('Faces of France' , 1937). The career ofJean Renoir is a particularly ('Boudu saved from drowning' , 1932) gives way to the anticapitalist Crime de Monsieur Lange ('The crime of Monsieur Lange' 1935) and the militant La Vie est à nous ('Life is ours' , 1936) But Renoir was not alone.

The Popular Front did not change the industrial strucmade outside the mainstream. But frontism made far deeper inroads into popular   entertainment than for example, in Britain, where the mainstream film industry took very little cognizance of social problems, and where aesthetic innovation was more in the direction of Korda's historical spectaculars than of any serious engagement with social reality. It was left to the reform-minded sponsored documentary pioneered by John Grierson and the

more radical and often Communist-inspired workers' film movement to raise social issues and insert 'actuality' into the cinema. But the films of the documentary movement enjoyed only a limited circulation in the pre-war period. were mostly screened to political and voluntary organizations and were rarely   programmed in commercial cinemas It was not until the war that documentary came into its own as a medium of education and propaganda, and when it did were sub ordinated to the war effort They

## THE SECOND WORLD WAR

The Second World began in Europe in September 1939. In cinematic terms, its first immediate effect in Britain was that the government briefly closed all the cinemas and was only reluctantly persuaded to reopen them. Its next effect was that, as the German blitzkrieg progressed, Hollywood lost its lucrative export markets in countries they were subject to strict German censorship and control\_ As one French historian wryly observed, the Vichy was a very one for French cinema, since choice of French or German films to go to the public invariably chose French ones.

More interesting was the effect on feature films. Unlike the First World War; the emphasis in batant countries was much less on whipping up hatred against the enemy; and far more on creating a sense of national and solidarity in the face of an external meant abandoning the values of building socialism (and its correlative; the parafavour of those of the united defence of the motherland.

In the United States , further removed a home front had less resonance and the bulk of feature film production re unity

In the combatant countries the situation was different. Both Germany and Britain rapidly put their film industries on a War (which was forced to evacuate its Moscow and Leningrad studios and relocate production in central Asia) and, to lesser extent, the United States (where many film-makers, including John Ford, found themselves drafted for service)Documentary and newsreels   acquired new importance and, in some cases, popularity. Though many ofthe obligatory shorts provided by the British Ministry of Information were less than warmly welcomed, Humphrey Jennings and Stewart McAllister's Listen to Britain (1942) was rapturously applauded, and Boulting's featurelength Desert was a box office hit the Roy Victory

The end of the war in 1945, though universally welcomed, had a bitter epilogue in the form of the Cold War: In the Soviet Union and its new satellites, the authoritarian forms of so-called Socialist Realism were imposed, or reimposed, with vengeance\_ And in the United States in which ideological tensions, though never absent; had abated in the war years hys-

classical era of French cinema, of well-defined genres and industrial structures, and a time when the was the main form of popular entertainment. During these years, many of the great classics of French cinema were produced, Grande Illusion (1937), Les Enfants du paradis (1943-5), Casque d'or (1951), and Mon oncle (1958) At the same time, it was serious Itical unrest, and a World War. Ifthe era opened on the sound revolution, heralding a new film language and the increased popularity of the medium, it ended more ambiguously: the end of the 1950s saw both the exhilarating emergence of the New Wave and the beginning of a decline in cinema attendances. period polit

## FROM THE COMING OF SOUND TO THE POPULAR FRONT

The coming of sound took the French film industry by surprise. Though the French cinema was artistically rich in the 1920s, Hollywood was dominant and production had dropped in 1926. Additionally; though French scientists had invented sound systems as early as 1900, none had been patented, so that American and German systems had to be imported. The first French sound films (LEau du Nil (The water of the Nile') Le Collier de la Reine than silent films with extra sound passages It took René sound film on the map. Initially in France, this populist tale about a street singer (Albert Préjean) became a huge world-wide success. Not only did it use sound and-music imaginatively; but it popularized nostalgic vision of old Paris and its 'little people' , which subsequently characterized many French films. flop

French film-makers quickly adapted to the talkies, and the early 1930s saw features produced, shooting up to 157 in 1931, settling eventually at around 130 flms per figure which with the exception Qf the 1940s, has been kept up until the present Apart from two vertically integrated conglomerates, Gaumont-Franco Film-Aubert (GFFA) and Pathé-Natan, both formed in the late 1920s, pro down

duction was in the hands of a myriad of individual pro ducers, with shaky finances. As in French society at large\_ scandals and bankruptcies, aggravated by the recession, were common. Both GFFA and Pathé-Natan had effectively collapsed by 1934. Government attempts at putting the French flm industry in order came to little, despite repeated demands from the industry; worried also about competition Hollywood (for French film shown, there were two to three US ones throughout the 1930s, and distribution was largely in American hands) However, with a few exceptions, top boxoffice successes of the decade were French from

After their initial weakness , studios around Paris (Épinay; Boulogne-Billancourt, Joinville) and in the south of France (Marseilles, Nice) strengthened their equipment and expertise. The booming film scene was cosmopolitan, occasionally provoking xenophobic attacks from the right, at a time when the political scene was sharply divided and anti-Semitism on the rise. Yet France was , in other ways, welcoming: to the strong Russian community ofthe 1920s were added layers of German and central European émigrés. From 1929 to 1932, many came to make multilanguage versions, a method in use before dubbing and subtitling, especially in the Paramount studios in Joinville, nicknamed 'Babel on-Seine' Many made lasting contributions to French cinema: Lazare Meerson (a Russian) and the Hungarian Alexandre Trauner dominated set design; creating the famous Parisian décors of the films of Clair, Carné, and others. Star French camUfa-trained Kurt Courant and Eugen Schüfftan, jointly establishing the look of Poetic Realism. Directors like Billy Siodmak all shot films in Paris on their way to Hollywood; substantial number of French films until the war. Ophuls, who eventually took French nationality, came back to Paris in the 195Os from

The coming of sound put an end to the avant-garde, but silent film directors, like Clair, Jean Renoir Jacques Feyder; Marie Epstein and Jean Benoît-Lévy; Julien Duvivier; Jean made the transition and became prominent directors in

the 1930s and beyond; they were joined by newcomers like Carné (Feyder's assistant) and the Spanish émigré Jean Vigo. who tragically died in 1934, leaving two brilliant features, Zéro de conduite ('Nought for behaviour' , 1933) and LAtalante (1934). One of the greatest changes brought by sound was the from the theatre and music hall: Raimu, Harry Baur, Jean Simon, Françoise Rosay; to name the most famouswere supported by many character actors such as Carette Saturnin Pauline Carton, Robert le Vigan, and Bernard Blier; their familiar faces and mannerisms drew popular loyalty just as much as the big stars did, and became one of the enduring delights of the classical French cinema\_ They they

generation of script-writers emerged with Henri Jeanson and Charles Spaak. Many directors worked in filmed theatre, such as Yves Mirande and Louis Verneuil\_ but Guitry, who both filmed their own plays, with technical help at first. Pagnol celebrated his southern culture, for instance in the Marius, Fanny; and César (1931, 1932 1936, providing Raimu with the part of a lifetime and also starring Orane Demazis and Pierre Fresnay) and La baker's wife 1938). always starring himself, showcased his urbane and voluble Parisian persona\_ in such gems as Faisons un rêve ('Let's dream and Le Roman dun tricheur ('The tale of a trickster' both 1936). Guitry

The novelty of sound prompted the two most popular genres of the early 193Os: musicals and filmed theatre\_ ours' , 1932), and Quatorze juillet ('14 July' , 1932) in which he bent genre conventions to suit his own auteurist preoccupations, musicals tended to be 'straight' filmed oper('The road to paradise' , 1930), were German films made in Germany in two versions , launching such stars as Henri Garat and Lilian Harvey. Thanks to Le Million and Quatorze juillet, Annabella became the top female French star. But another; lesser-known type of musical took the French cinema by storm: simple, cheaply made stories built around music hall comic singers,   especially   Georges MiltonBach' , and Fernandel. A very idiosyncratic subset of this genre was the military vaudeville (comique troupier) critically scorned but much appreciated by the audience; Fernandel starred in one of its greatest hits, Ignace (1937). Many other music hall performers, such as Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, and  Mistinguett,   appeared, later on in the decade, a new generation of singers and musicians: Tino Rossi, Charles Trenet, and the Ventura band This was the typical fare of the 'cinema du sam'di soir' when people went regularly to their local flea-pit Or to the new picture palaces in big city centres, like Gaumontloved filmed theatre (straight play adaptations) also OI indirectly) on satirical boulevard comedies, is now fascinating testimony the period; it also actors like Berry or Raimu the opportunity to show off their flamboyant  style, and script-writers chance to guage, shared by the audience, strongly contributed to specifically French cinema, in the face of the Hollywood 'threat' . It also heralded the unique place of script-writers in French cinema. Playwrights like Marcel Achard, and like Jacques Prévert, wrote for the screen, and a new Ray great gave poets

But if such light-hearted and comic genres dominated darker realist-melodramatic current in French cinema as Raymond Bernard's Les Misérables The wretched' , 1933) and Maurice Tourneur's Les Deux Orphelines ('The two little orphan 1932), but melodramatic genres emerged: the military or navy melodrama (Double Crime sur la 1937; La Porte du large ('Gateway to the sea') 1936), highsociety dramas , like Marcel LHerbier's Le Bonheur 1935) and Abel Gance's Paradis   perdu Slav' melodrama, a type of elaborate costume drama set in fantasy eastern Europe (Mayerling. 1936; Katia, 1938), and strongly indebted to the Russian émígrés; its romantic stars were Danielle Darrieux Pierre But, internationally; the 1930s are especially associated with the more gritty Poetic Realism Based on realist literature or original scripts and usually set in working-class milieux; Poetic Realist films featured pessimistic narratives and night-time settings, and a dark, contrasted, visual style prefiguring American film noir. Many great auteurs of the time chose this idiom: Pierre Dernier Tournant ('The last turning') 1939), Julien Duvivier (La Bandera, 1935; Pépé  le Moko, 1936). Jean Grémillon (Gueule d'amour ('The face of love') 1937; Remorques ('Trailers') . 1939-40), Jean Renoir (La Bête humaine ('The dance hostess'). 1938). Starting with Jenny in 1936, Carné and Prévert best represented the tradition with Le Quai des brumes ('Misty quay' 1938) and Le Jour se lève ('Daybreak' 1939). Though Poetic Realism produced 'mythical' women characters (for instance those played by Michèle Morgan drama was that of the male hero, usually embodied by girls' ,

The doomed universe of Poetic Realist films was said to reflect the gloomy morale of the immediate pre-war years.

Having become chief designer in 1937, Trauner would continue the system of apprenticeships from which he learnt, by taking on Paul Bertrand as assistant for Jeux Interdits (René Clément, 1952) and Gcrvalse (Clément, 1956) Trauner's reputation was secured by his designs rector Marcel Carné and script-writer Jacques Prévert, Trauner may legitimately be considered as coauteur of and Les Enfants du paradis (1945).

He described the function of set designer as 'to diate graspon the character'$ psychology' . His sustained collaboration with Carné and Prévert over eight Gilms 1937 to 1950 emphasized this function.

There is some truth in this, though Carné, like many politically conscious directors of the time, had earlier espoused the more hopeful ideology of the Popular Front, the left-centre alliance in power from 1936 to 1938, which spurred a remarkable rallying of intellectuals and artists , most   prominent director; and undoubtedly the towering artistic fgure over Le Crime de Monsieur Lange ('Monsieur Lange's crime' , 1935), as well as his most directly committed films La Vie est à nous ('Life is ours' La Marseillaise (1937), all engaged with the climate of hope and class solidarity which characterized this brief period.

## CINEMA IN THE FASCIST PERIOD

When pushed, cinema historians usually point to couple of silent films of 1929,by two of the most important directors of the following decade: Sole Sun')  Alessandro Blasetti's first film; and Rotaie ('Rails') by Mario Camerini, which was released in a sound version in 1931

In 1926 it intervened for the first time in the field of cinema, taking over the Istituto Nazionale LUCEacronym the National Institute of the Union of Cinematography and Education formed in 1924. The regime thus created for itself a monopoly of cinematic information: LUCE produced docuprojection of the latter was made compulsory.

The first Italian sound films were produced at the Itala Stefano Pittaluga, following his acquisition in 1926 of the Turinese company Fert. 1930 were the work of Cines-Pittaluga. Pittaluga was an energetic and intelligent entrepreneur; surrounded by peers who were often hasty, incompetent, and amateurish But he died suddenly in the spring of 1931, at the age of 44, leaving behind him powerful circuit of interests: production company, studios, technical oratories, a distribution organization, and a vast chain of outlets all over Italy. acting

Whilst the early history of North American cinema is characterized by the shift from New York to Los Angeles, from east to centre of political and bureaucratic power: pull years

The first legislative support for the industry came from Law 918 (18 June 1931), which assigned 10 per cent of boxoffice takings to 'aid all sectors of the film industry and, in particular; to reward those with a proven ability to cater for the tastes of the public' . As in other felds, the Fascist regime and the industry were in full agreement: above all. profit

On the other hand, its hasty compromises and chameleon-like pragmatism ably adapted to any and all necessities .

Only the third of the four merits attention; because of Blasetti's generous and honest commitment to the ideolfaith was apparent in his other works: in Sole (1929) and in Terra madre ('Mother against realistic social, rural backdrop--and in the militaristic rhetoric of Aldebaran (1936) and the nationalist and Francophobe sentiment of Ettore Fieramosca (1938). good

Fascist propaganda is also evident in around thirty and these may be divided into four categories:

Patriotic films: from   documentary footage of the First World War to Scarpe al sole ('Shoes in the sun' , 1935); from Cavalleria ('Cavalry' , 1936) to Luciano Serra mentary Uomini sul fondo (Men in the deep', 1941) and 2.

For Gli uomini che mascalzoni took the camera out of the studio and on to the streets of Milan, amongst the stands and the people of the commercial fair; thus anticipating a tendency of post-war neo realism. Location scenes of street life are also feature of the first film by Raffaello Matarazzo, the little-known Treno popolare 'People's train' , 1933), which was only rediscovered at the end of the 1970s by a younger generation of critics\_

Anti-Bolshevik and anti-Soviet propaganda films: these include two films on the Spanish Civil War; both 1939: Lassedio dell'Alcazar (The siege of the Alcazar' by Genina, made with powerful choral elements, and the less polished Carmen tra i rossi ('Carmen and the Reds') by Edgar Neville, who went on to direct Sancta Maria (1941). Other films in this category are Luomo della croce 'Man of the 1943) by Rossellini, Odessa in fiamme ('Odessa in flames' 1942) by Gallone, and Odissea di sangue ('Blood diptych Noi vivi Farewell, Kira' , a somewhat different case, since it is Stalinism rather than Communism itself which is attacked from

The 'official' cinema of the twenty-year period of Fascist rule ebratory, but it only represented 5 per cent of national production: superstructure rather than base. The base was bourgeois , or better petty bourgeois, and Janus-faced, divided between family and Empire, between sentimentalism and grandiloquence, between 'dopolavoro" (the 'after-work' workers clubs set up by the regime) and the military  At the highest level of achievement; these two faces are reflected by the two most important directors of the 1930s: Mario Camerini and Alessandro

Camerini's films appear modest, toned down, marked by careful attention to detail, graceful sense of irony, and a European mastery of the techniques of expression His are shrewd descriptions of the middle and lower

middle classes which reveal the customs and habits of the time, to the extent that some have maintained that, had it not been for his collaboration with scriptwriter Cesare Zavattini, De Sica's post-war work would have been but imitation of Camerini pale

Blasetti's career was less consistently successful and more eclectic than Camerini's. His best films were 1860 of the early days of Garibaldi's Thousand' , and Un'avventura di Salvator Rosa ('An adventure for Salvator Rosa 1940), and perspicacious portrait of the teenth-century and painter. He also made films of a heroic and grandiloquent kind, most apparent in spectacles such as La corona di ferro ( The iron crown' , 1941) low-key and realistic vein in La tavola dei poveri ('The table of the 1932) and, most successfully; in Quattro Zavattini. witty poet grand passi

Despite the individual talent of figures like Blasetti and Camerini, the driving force behind Italian cinema remained the escapist film, or as Luchino Visconti had it in a 1943 polemic, a cinema ofcorpses Its style was much closer than is commonly acknowledged to Hollywood products of the same period: it split into distinct genres; it relied on the cult of stars; and it cultivated, with only occasional success, the image of the director as nificant player by far was Emilio Cecchi's Cines, which was the only production company to resemble Hollywood-style studio, but which is also noteworthy for its attempt to reconcile experimental innovation with the demands ofbusiness, individual creativity with mass production. The principal genres were comedy, melodrama, and costume-cum-historical drama. The comedies were for frivolous and vacuous, based on rejection of reality in

And many of his film performances derive directly from his days in the theatre.

The era of the 'white telephones coincided with, and was a direct effect of, the steady increase in the volume of Mussolini ordered that 'one hundred films a year' should be the target, only thirty-two feature-length films were made. The following year; when the government suddenly passed a law setting limits on the importing of American films, provoking the pullout of the Big Four\_MGM, Warners, Fox, and Paramount production leapt to 60 titles, and then to 87 in 1940 and 120 in 1942

This growth fed the power of the star actors: on top of the group of early 1930s stars-Vittorio De Sica, Assia Noris , Elsa Merlini, Maria Denis, Isa Mirandacame new names such as Amedeo Nazzari and Alida Valli, Osvaldo Valenti and Luisa Ferida, Fosco Giachetti, Clara Calamai, Doris Duranti, and so on.

Around 1940, two new trends in film-making emerged. The first, represented by film-makers such as Mario Soldati, Alberto Lattuada, Renato Castellani, and Luigi Chiarini, returned to the literature of the nineteenth century Or to the 'art prose' of contemporary writing.

Ferdinando Maria Poggioli, whom recent critics have tended to set alongside Camerini and Blasetti in importance, belongs to the first trend, but has many affinities and Soldati, less refined than Castellani, but he was able to construct stronger narrative lines than others. Gelosia ('Jealousy' 1943) and Il cappello del prete (The priest's hat' , 1943) are exemplary adaptations of literary texts. Sissignora ('Yes, Ma'am' , 1941) is minor but unusual work which combines a sentimental story-line with realist elements and a certain formalist inspiration

In the war years, the screenwriters , directors, technicians, and actors who were to be the protagonists of the new realist cinema after 1945 were already working. Three films made during the war revealed the hidden face of an Italy in Quattro passi tra le nuvole, by Blasetti (1942); bambini ci 1942), by De Sica; and above all Ossessione (1943) by Visconti. All three were already works of opposition. deep

## LIBERATION AND NEO-REALISM

With Rome Open City (Roma città aperta, 1945), shot by Rossellini between 1944 and 1945 in haphazard conditions with economic and practical difficulties of all kinds, Italy returned to the forefront of world cinema. Shortly therehad already been used in the 1930s with reference to literature and the figurative arts. According to Luchino Visconti, the first person to apply it to cinema was the Rather than was part of a general turn towards realism in cinema of the time, providing new way of looking at and ance. It was distinguished not only by its headon but also by the impulse to suggest positive solution to those problems and to marry the causes of individuals and of society 'as people wanted it to be'. rep

Most of the directors , screen-writers, and technicians involved in neo-realism had years of experience behind them De Sica's debt to Camerini is evident, as is Rossellini's to the technical expertise of De Robertis. Another crucial influence was the broadening of cultural horizons carried out by Umberto Barbaro and Luigi Chiarini at the Centro Sperimentale and in the journals Bianco nero (founded in 1937) and Cinema (1936), whose contributors writers and directors such as Carlo atmosphere of Milan, and included Luigi Comencini, and Dino Risi. Also foreign influences were far from negligible: French realism (above all Jean

At the heart of the implicit ideology of neo-realism lies the positive and generous\_ if a little generic, desire for profound renewal of people and society   Hence some have suggested that its base values are humanistic; and that it is therefore inaccurate to talk of a Marxist revolutionary hegemony behind the films. After all, the renewal of people and things is far socialist transformation, and fraternity is not the same as class solidarity Only few films provided even latently trema (The earth shakes by  Visconti, both made in 1948 The former; produced Association of Italian Partisans,   used both   propaganda and melodrama to elucidate the class structure of Italy (represented by Lombard village) under German occupation.

Setting an end point to the development of neorealist cinema has become critical convention, as has the use of the term itself. For the writer and critic Franco Fortini, writing in 1953, however, the term is misconceived, and a better term would be 'neo-populism' since neo-realism expressed a 'vision of reality founded on the primacy of the with its corollaries of regionalism and dialect and its components of Christian and revolutionary tarianism'

As far as an end is concerned, if the parabola begins in 1945 with Rome Open City; it can be said to end with Umberto Din 1952.It very soon went into irreversible internal causes was an inadequate cultural hinterland Four currents of thought had infiltrated post-war Italian intellectual life: Marxism; existentialism; sociology; and first and hardly any trace of the other three Even its rejection of character in favour of the immersion in everyday life, and rejection of fantasy; led directors to on film the dialectical relations between the various compoint

And that cement was, in the last analysis , product of the political, civic\_ and existential upheaval of the war and the passage dictatorship to democracy; change from

## THE EASY YEARS

years as the ironic title of Zampa's 1953 film had it-for Italian cinema. In 1955, the first year of television in Italy box-office sales reached a peak of 819 million, never equalled before or since. The 25 films made in 1945 had already become 62 in 1946, 104 in 1950 and, with high point of 201 in 1954, and a relative slump to 133 in 1955, reached 167 in 1959. With the avalanche of American films, often up to four or five years old, which flooded the market at the end of the war, home products took only fraction from 13 per cent in the immediate post-war years to 34 1954 and edging towards a of 50 per cent at the end of the decade\_ peak

Nazzari and Yvonne Sanson. In comedy, there was the extraordinary phenomenon of Totò-the most inspired clown ofthe second half of the century-whose Totò a colori of 1955 was the first Italian film in Ferraniacolor, and the emergence of Alberto Sordi as a genuine archetype of the vices and virtues of the contemporary Italian. In the field of the epic costume drama, or 'supercolossus' Hollywood was challenged at its own game by Camerini's Ulysses (Ulisse, 1954) with Kirk Douglas , Vidor's War and Peace (1956), Lattuada's La tempesta 1958), and Henry Koster's La Maja desnuda (The Naked Maja, 1958).

This was yet one more sign of the American domination of the British film industry by the 1920s, the outcome of several combined advantages \_ America had the largest home audience of any national film industry; so producers were able to cover production costs at home; making practically all earnings abroad into American distributors thus had the spoke profits

The popularity of American films with audiences made British exhibitors reluctant to book British-made films, further   disabling home  industry.

On the 'high' level of art cinema, the trio Visconti Fellini-Antonioni replaced the 1940s trio Rossellini-De Sica-Visconti. After La terra trema (1948), more a sort of enchanting Marxist mystery play than the apotheosis of neo-realism seen in it by many critics (in retrospect, Bellissima his Visconti moved on to Senso (1954), where his penchant for profaned Romanticism and collapse came to the fore.

The American studios would now have to pay for their dominance by financing the production of a quota of British films while also some back for exhibition in the United States. In the event Warner Bros\_ and Paramount were the only two companies to set up serious production subsidiaries in Britain to fulfil their shot to satisfy the terms of the Act but often financed at a rate per foot and barely intended to be screened. These gained British pictures an even worse name with audiences , though their production provided a useful training ground for future directors, as Michael Powell taking such

The 1927 Act also created conditions for the British industry to emulate the American pattern of verticalintegration; with the same monopolistic organization pro distributing, and exhibiting its own films. By the end of 1929, Gaumont-British, an amalgam of companies assembled by Isidore Ostrer and his brothers Mark and Maurice, owned over 300 cinemas, and had under its wing Michael Balcon Early in 1928 John Maxwell set up an organization linking the ABC circuit; which was to have eightyeight cinemas by 1929, with Elstree Studios under Herbert Wilcox (called British International Pictures), and distribution arm formed from First National and Pathé For sway over British distribution, making it essential that any flm have a contract with one of them to attain decent exposure. ducing,

From late 1928 there arose 'atmospherics' , like the Astorias in Streatham Brixton, and Finsbury Park, and the built by   Sidney Bernstein at Tooting and Woolwich. Following the American model, these cinemas had large; elaborate interiors, often in Moorish, oriental designed to supply audiences with the romance for which they crave of cinemas developed in the mid-1930s had a different aura\_ Unlike the 'atmospherics' had uniform, sleek style; they cream-tiled vast curtain walls, streamlined red lettering, and nighttime floodlighting   echoing the designs of the new London underground stations which frequently neighboured. they they

The 1930s were period of general increase in the standard of living, despite the slow-down in industrial Unemployment seems to have had little effect upon cinema admissions, even among those who were most affected by it. Audiences were by all accounts poorer, working-class Britons, with urban young people and women (particularly in the most frequent attenders, and the female population's opinion was carefully monitored by exhibitors as guide to profits. Contemporary surveys indicate that cinema's appeal lay in its provision of a form of escape, a site for courtship, and mode of social currency, being able to talk about what you had seen. The main competing entertainment for this audience was in which several of the more popular British film stars of the 1930s initially made their names: Gracie Fields, George Formby, Will Frank Randle, Sid Field , Tommy Trinder, and the Crazy The between the worlds of film and variety were close and some of the exhibition circuits owned halls which still staged variety; while others mixed, 'kine-variety pres entations. being variety Gang.

Alfred Hitchcock's prolific British period of film-making lasted from 1925 to 1939 He directed twenty-two of his   fifty-three films in these years, for GaumontBritish/Gainsborough Films and for British International Pictures. Hitchcock was the foremost, highest-paid British director of the 1930s. His films were successful at the boxoffice; helping him to attain an unusual degree of artistic control in a climate in which producers usually held sway.

However; there were zones of widespread appeal in British film-making of the 1930s,linked to the possibilities offered by synchronized sound. In the United States sound ones: the musical, thegangster film, thescrewballcomedy. In Britain, sound transformed feature film production in three Hitchcock; musical comedy, especially the popular films of Jessie Matthews, Gracie Fields, Will and George Focmby; and the accomplished most spectacularly by Alexander Korda's London Films.

Anny Ondra in Blackmail (1929) plays the first in long line of tormented and attacked blonde women who will face the horror of witnessing death. The film begins with documentary chase sequence, and ends with surrealpursuitusing trickeffectsin afamiliarlocation; the British Museum. Theeveryday setting harbouring extreme events was to recur, in The Man who Knew Too Much (1934),in The 39 Steps (1935) in Sabotage (1936) in The Lady Vanishes (1938), and in others, and is typical of Hitchcock's preference for personal narratives, involving young, innocent couples, set within the troubled European politics of

These consensus' films can be seen to reflect the remarkable political stability provided by the National Government through the 1930s.A Conservative-dominated coalition of parties was elected to power in 1931, re-elected in 1935, was to preserve the peace and maintain the status quo, which required in the late 1930s an appeasement of Hitler and the Nazi government in Germany.

A significant marker of his ambition for the picture was Korda's staging of its première at the world's largest cinema, Radio City Music Hall, New York, paving the way for its hugely successful opening in London under the label 'London Film Prestige Production' . The success of The Private Life of Henry VIII turned Korda into a major producer with backing from United Artists, promises of American distribution, and British banking and corporate support from the Prudential Assurance Company, which financed new studios at Denham. His acquisition of a halfshare in the Odeon circuit in 1936 also guaranteed a much-needed British outlet. The Laughton film heralded sequence of spectacular Korda-produced releases designed for the international market, emphasizing special effects and colour; in an atmosphere removed as far as possible from the realities of everyday British life.

1930s Herbert Wilcox made two hagio graphic films about the life of Queen Victoria, Victoria the Great (1938) and Glorious Years (1939), and Michael Balcon   produced ardent Empire films for GaumontBritish: Rhodes of Africa (1936), The Great Barrier (1936), and King Solomon's Mines (1937). But it was Alexander Korda's London Films which presented the most exuberant myths of a glorious imperial Britain. Korda set up London Films 1931 after substantial film career in his native the American market, Korda hit the jackpot with The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), a costume biography of the notorious monarch directed by himself with Charles Laughton as the but also starring the young Merle Oberon and Robert Donat, who was to become a Sixty key

Korda produced four key Empire films in the second half of the decade: Sanders of the River (1935) Elephant (1937), The Drum (1938), and The Four Feathers (1939). They were even cooperation from government, suggesting official satisfaction with their vision of the imperial world. Recommendations of the British Board of Film Censors also shaped the films' pro Empire stance While the BBFC was not government body, it had close ties to politics; and consistently rejected Boy

film scripts which reflected adversely on imperial institutions References to the imnpact on the Empire of war and independence movements were omitted from the films, as were the tensions and struggles between classes , races, and sexes that Empire entailed. Instead this celluloid empire existed fundamentally undisturbed by change. In the words of Jeffrey Richards (1984), 'The films offer no concrete political, economicOr constitutional justification for the Empire's existence. The Empire is justified in the apparent moral superiority of the British, demonstrated by their adherence to the code of gentlemanly conduct and the maintenance of a disinterested system oflaw and justice\_ In these films British men know how to do the right resulting in the quelling of uprisings the renewed security of the Empire. thing' and

If there is a chink in the imperial narrative armour of these films it is at their domestic edges, where the price to be for constructing an Empire through the image of the British gentleman becomes visible In Sanders of the River   (again directed by Zoltan missioner Sanders keeps a local uprising at bay in Nigeria through his alliance with Chief Bosambo, played by Paul Robeson--who uses his fabulous   singing to mollify When Sanders takes leave to marry, as now Bosambo's people (and above all his wife Lilongo) are vulnerable to the warring Mofalaba and the corruption of white mercenaries. Sanders 's call to conjugalunion to propagate the babies of Empire jeopardizes his life's work; his honeymoon must be delayed , perhaps repeatedly; to serve and save the realm. The film ends with Sanders returning to his river; assisting in the rescue of Lilongo and the demise of Mofalaba and the mercenaries, and creating Bosambo of the River as he starts his furlough again. paid King King King

In the colourfully vibrant The Four Feathers (directed by Korda's brother Zoltan) Harry Faversham is born to family of generations of men who have fought for the Empire, but Harry is repulsed by its requirements and refuses to join the forces in the reconquest of the Sudan. His wife Ethne now rejects him, explaining that were both 'born to a code' that obey.

The most successful films of this genre were those starring Gracie Fields, then at the height of her popularity Her films contrast with Korda's Empire genre in their rootedness in working life and in the relative complexity with which they present class divisions.

The question of cinema's social impact and its role in class relations had become more urgent in the 1930s as the mass unemployed voice became louder, and as sound cinema itself brought the question of class to the fore; spoken accent. A network of film societies and film journals burgeoned intensively   screening and discussing recent Sovietcinema. There was asocialist film movement, organized around independent cinemas and working Soviet films. In 1933 the British Film Institute was set up with specifically educational mandate, distributing documentary work. There was also a flourishing documentary film-making movement, funded by a variety of organizations from the Empire Marketing Board to the gas supply industry; and inspired above all by John Grierson's General Post Office Film Unit. All this activity helped develop seriousness for film as a social force, concern which was to spread further into. feature filmagain

With the outbreak of war, scrutiny of the social role of cinema intensified. Recognizing the profound influence of film-going on psychological mood and opinion; Parliament issued official guidelines to studios advocating certain subject-matters and forbidding others . Recommended themes were 'what Britain is fighting for' 'how Britain fights' , and the need for sacrifice if the fight is to be won' .

## EALING, GAINSBOROUGH, AND HAMMER

The loudest and most influential of the many wartime voices calling for a new school of realist cinema in Britain had been that of Michael Balcon. He had taken charge of although continuing to make the popular musical comedies that had been the studio's mainstay through the 1930s, he wanted a cinema more in touch with the issues ofcontemporary British life, in both appearance and story. For this he recruited two figures from the documentary sector: Harry Watt, who had written and directed Crown Film Unit; and Brazilian-born Alberto Cavalcanti, who had been member of the Parisian avant-garde in the 1920s and had come to England in 1934 to work for John Grierson at the GPO key

Balcon also recruited Charles Frend, Charles Crichton and Robert Hamer, and these three, together with Watt and Basil Dearden, remained at the studio well into the of personnel, who had lowish but regular wages, together with continuity in the script-writing department (including above all T.

attempt at horror with Dead of Night (1945), to Pink and Wax (1945), a stage melodrama set in Victorian London. However, comedy returned as the studio's dominant product. While Ealing's Will and George Formby films had been popular in the war years, comedy had then taken back seat until Hue and Cry (directed by Charles Crichton) in 1947. The film adopts realist, documentaryinspired camera work to create familiar background of post-war London life and then develops fantastic, contrasting plot in that setting to produce humour: This provided the model for the famous comedies that followed: Passport to Pimlico (1949), Whisky Galore!

Balcon had been a fierce spokesman during the war for the role of the independent film producer, serving on the government's Palache Committee in 1943 to investigate monopoly in the film industry. However, after the war he had signed very attractive distribution deal with Rank which provided 50 per cent financing on all films, ensuring Balcon degree of freedom from international pressures. This proved short-lived, and although the postwar comedies tended to be very successful in the United States, as was Frend's war film The Cruel Sea (1953), it was not enough to sustain the studio Despite loans from the newly established National Film Finance poration in the early 1950s, Studios were forced to Ealing Ealing Cor

The end of the 1940s had seen a crisis in the British cinema, which had affected even the largest studios, and from which many 1947 the Labour government slapped 75 per cent Dalton Tax (named after the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) on all ailing British economy. Hollywood responded with a sixmonth boycott of the British market. Stocks of American films in Britain was no immediate gap to be filled, and reissues of old embargo renewed temptation among British producers to beat Hollywood at its own game: Rank's reaction was to up production in the absence of US films. In March 1948 Hollywood lifted its ban after the signing of a new four-year pact favouring American interests, and the 75 per cent tax. The market was flooded and all British films lost heavily, particulafly because many of them had been rushed through production and were of poor quality: step lifting

the verge of bankruptcy; and the Rank Organization was also suffering. In July the government announced approval of the National Film to provide loans for British film-making.

The studio had its origins in distribution company, Exclusive Films, started in 1935 by Enrique Carreras and Will Hinds, whose stage name was Will Hammer. In 1947 the company was reorganized to move into production and renamed Hammer Films, with Carreras's son James as managing director. Carreras prudently insisted on tight financial controls, with NFFC loans back on time, and production costs ruthlessly technique was to make all films in one rented location rather than renting a studio for each production and having to transport equipment, sets, and personnel.

More than 1,500 film-makers-many of whom were Jews as pro gressives and independents-would Germany, replaced hacks and second-rate opportunists . In the minds of its most severe detractors , Nazi cinema represents the antithesis of Weimar's revered 'haunted screen' (Lotte Eisner) An infamous entity; its most memorable achievement is the systematic abuse of film's formative powers in the name of mass manipulation, state terror; and world-wide destruction. flee

Goebbels set out to film from the

lectual liberalism, and commercial pandering. It should emanate from political life and find its way to the deepest recesses of German spirit. In his early programmatic declarations, he mixed natural and martial metaphors, speaking of film as body and territorial surface, declaring himself the physician whose surgery would exorcize an afflicted organism of harmful alien elements 'It takes to grant life to the innermost purpose and innermost constitution ofa new world:' Repeatedly; Goebbels stressed how film should exercise a discernible effect (Wirkung) how it must act on hearts and minds. Its calling should be that of art (Volkskunst), an art that simultaneously serves state purposes and fulfils personal needs. Political ideas were to however; simply reenacting party parades, documenting stormtroopers, and fetishizing flags and emblems. Authentic film art must transcend the everyday; indeed, it should 'intensify life popular

The vast majority of films made under Goebbels, many revisionist historians now insist, bear few signs of ideological resolve or official intervention. Hitler Youth Quex, and other state sponsored productions may well warrant the appellation Nazi propaganda. None the less, such 'state films stitute a very small portion ofthe era's films, posing excep tions and not the rule. So-called 'unpolitical features in fact provided the overwhelming majority; besides a plethlight fare directed by ever-active industry pros like E Willi Birgel, Marika Rökk, and Zarah Leander; as well as character actors such as Heinz Rühmann, Paul Kemp, Fita Benkhoff, Theo Lingen, Grete Weiser; Paul Hörbiger; and Hans Moser. Many of these films receive recognition as noteworthy achievements, as unblemished classics of German cinema, in some cases even versive energies. Such works seem to demonstrate that they reflect a sphere not completely lorded over by state institutions and reveal an everyday with a much less sinister countenance Kolberg public

It is in any case clear that National Socialism governed less by external compulsion than by an appeal to the imaginary. If Hitler's State expected sacrifice and devotion, it also offered amenities in the forms of consumer and creature comforts recall the 'feelies of Huxley's Brave New World, innocuous and agreeable packages of diversion\_ Goebbels sought to imbue mass culture with cultic values , to aestheticize the political in order to anaesthetize the populace.

In his essay of 1926, 'Cult of Distraction' , Siegfried Kracauer had described urban mass public desperately hungry for experience; seeking in the dark of cinemas the Goebbels knew well that an enthralled and spellbound subject would prove much more malleable than a viewer harangued by audio-visual terror. The Minister no doubt sponsored a fair number of official state productions with distinct political slant and worked hard so that newsreels might yield tendentious effects. None the less, he clearly favoured subtle persuasion over the obvious touch. Forthis reason helauded the imagistic strength and visual seduction of Trenker and Riefenstahl and actively cultivated stylists like Willy Forst, Detlef Sierck (soon to emieven occasionally tolerating less reliable non-conformists Staudte.

When speaking of American cinema, reviewers in the Third Reich often saw the popular German film in terms of the Propaganda Ministry's dreams. Among the Hollywood successes, nobody's films figured as strongly as those of Walt Disney: '1 present the Führer with thirty of the best films from the last four years and eighteen Mickey Mouse films for Christmas , Goebbels noted in his diary on 20 December 1937.'Heisvery pleased : Disney cartoons raised pure immanence and artistic illusion to transcendent heights.

Although light films and musicals constituted roughly half (and sometimes more) of annual feature production through 1937, only Glückskinder, Forst 's Allotria, Carl Froelich's Wenn wir alle Engel  wären we were all angels') and Wolfgang Liebeneiner's Der Mustergatte ('An idealhusband' ) stood out as truly resonant comedies .

cinema, Goebbels and his minions in crucial regards let Hollywood be their guide.

The NSDAP 'coordinated' institutions and organ-izations\_ The Ministry of Propaganda monitored film scripts, oversaw studio productions, and orchestrated responses. Despite all these measures , one could not simply mandate that German audiences like German films. Cultivating Hollywood above all meant a more effeccinema that could provide the ultimate application of power; a power that works discreetly, by signs and rep resentations. Glückskinder emulated American film in an attempt to incorporate it in a native dream factory. Martin's film propagated a Never Never Land created in studio and made for the cinema, a site of irresponsibility; reverie, and good cheer. This realm would serve as both a compromise and consolation. People more readily accepted collective identity as well as the illusion of a private life mass entertainments seemingly devoid of politics, prO increasingly demanded of Germans the constant sacrifice, the threat. Cinema, rather than espousing party mythologies , would become the site ofgrand illusions. And the grandest illusion created in German studios increasingly under state control was the illusion that within this State certain spaces remained beyond control\_especially the space of cinema and fantasy production. press

The Nazi public sphere operated along the ofwhat Goebbels called an 'orchestral principle' . Not every instrument plays the same when we hear a concert; still the result is a symphony. Hardly monolithic or monotone, Nazi culture energized a division of labour between light lines thing

touches and heavy hands Films worked together with other forms of diversion (radjo programmes mass rallies, tourist offerings) to organize work and leisure time in an effort to militate alternative experience and State productions and escapist entertainments functioned in tandem so that similarly 'extreme perspectives of extreme uniformity' could be for instance; found in the party document Triumph of the Will and the Tobis musical of 1939, We're Dancing around fare offered no escape from the Nazi status quo. against

Rarely did Nazi Germany so graphically display its awareness of the captivating potential of film techon cannonball flying through the sky provides the film's ultimate icon; essentializing a connection between cinema's power over human imaginations and war's tools of aggression.

National Socialism recognized that war involved both material territories and immaterial fields of perception Film ultimately became a weapon, an explosive arsenal of surprises and effects which made minds reel and emotions surrender under a constant barrage of stimulation. (It was no coincidence; Paul Virilio has noted, that colour production expanded during the Second World War and that the ultimate German war films , Münchhausen and Kolberg, appeared in Agfacolor:) What is interesting general-is the limits of its selfknowledge, the moments where   cynical sophistication yields to troubled sub jectivity and decided self-blindness. Münchhausen enacts peripatetic soldier's fantasy ofcontrol and likewise exhibits the fearful this fantasy. It shows us a Nazi hero created for an official celebration; it also glimpses of the pathology that shaped this hero and this occasion.

## East Central\_Europe Before the Second World War

## EARLY DAYS

The beginnings and subsequent development of cine matography in the countries of east central Europe share number of common features. In what are now the Czech Republic , Slovakia, Hungary; Serbia, Croatia, and Poland (then partitioned between Austria, Prussia, and Russia) the first Lumière film shows took place in 1896, in keen competition with entrepreneurs Thomas Alva Edison. 'Edison's men' arrived in Prague five Lumière brothers The Lumière Cinématographe was first exhibited in Belgrade in 1896, and in the Austrian sector of Poland in November of that year; though other Polish cities such as Warsaw, and Lvov were already familiar with the idea of animated photographs thanks to displays of Edison's Vitascope: using days May

There were many pioneers working on the idea of animated   photography in east central   Europe the most important being the Czech Jan Krizenecky, and the Poles Jan Kazimierz and Jan Szczepanik. This initial period of film development also the Polish photographer and film operator resident in Paris: 'Une nouvelle source de lhistoire (création d'un dépôt de cinématographie historique)' , and 'La photographie animée\_ ce qu'elle est et ce published in March and August 1898 respectively. Emphathe significance of motion picture photography; its cognitive potential, Matuszewski was the first to postulate the need to create comprehensive film archive, comprising every kind of film documentation sizing

In the countries of east central Europe; the first generation of people who worked with film were mainly stage actors, theatrical directors, journalists, professional pho tographers, and authors of popular literature. Pioneers of film production in Hungary included Mihály Kertész; an actor at the National Theatre, and the journalist Sándor Korda. After a decade and a halfoffilm-making in Hungary (their film output between 1912 and 1919 comprised thirty-nine and twenty-four items respectively), they went on to work with distinction in film industries abroad; Kertész in America, under the name Michael Curtiz, and Korda in England, as Alexander Korda.

The first full-length feature films in east central Europe were created after 1910, at the same time as in Italy and France. In 1911, with the participation of artists from the

Variety Theatre in Warsaw (then in the Russian sector) where he was both actor and director, Antoni Bednarczyk made the first Polish feature film entitled The History of Sin, based on the scandalous and highly popular novel by A further ten feature films were made in the same including three in Yiddish. By the outbreak and some 350 shorts (fiction, news films, documentaries) had been produced by the three sectors of partitioned Poland

In Hungary; the first 'artistic film drama was directed in 1912 by Mihály Kertész from screenplay by Ivan Siklosi and Imre Roboz, and entitled Ma es holnap (Today and and Ilona Aczel, actors from the National Theatre, and Mihály Kertész himself (from the Hungarian Theatre). The film's première, on 14 October 1912, is generally con sidered to be the birth of Hungarian cinema. The greatest success of Czech feature production was the screening of Bedžich Smetana's opera The Bartered Bride, directed by Oldrich Kminak (1913). In Belgrade, the first feature film involving the participation of actors was directed by Serb, Stojadinovié, the camera operator being Jules Berrie; Frenchman from the firm of Pathé.

One hundred and fourteen cinemas were magazines soon began to appear: kinematograf (1907), lished by Korda, Pesti mozi (1912), Mozi (1913), and Mozihet (1915-19) in Hungary; the Polish Kinoteatr i sport ( Cinema theatre and sport' 1914) and Scena ekran ('Stage and screen' 1913) Like the films of the time, show the mutual penetration of élite and mass culture pubthey

On Czech and Slovak soil the war similarly favoured the intensive development of selfsufficient film industry. Historians often trace to this period the beginnings of the trend known as 'cinema of small realism' , among whose precursors was Antonin Frencel's

As most of the fighting on the eastern front took place on Polish territory; the young Polish film industry found destroyed film production companies in the Austrian deported many of the actors who had hitherto supplied the basic film casts In practical terms, the only film company still operating on Polish territory during the war years was Aleksander Hertz's Sfinks where Pola Negri made her film début in Senses   (Niewolnica considerable diffculties succeeded in completing twentyfour full-length feature films over that period.

## THE POST-WAR YEARS

The end of the war and the collapse of the multi-national empires brought independence to the peoples of east central Europe and the creation ofnation states in Poland, Hungary; Czechoslovakia, and both the evolution of local film production and the thetics of the movies themselves. The dominant trend in most of these countries was towards screen adaptations of national classical literature and of popular best sellers.

## Yugoslavia

After the war, film production activity was relatively Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. As from

and Belgrade in Serbia. At the beginning of the 1920s the production company Yugoslavia Film operated in Zagreb, and turned out several feature films, documentaries, and news films, before folding a few years later. The Italian director and actor Tito Strozzi formed his own production company; Strozzi Film, and produced a full-length feature entitled Deserted Palaces (1925) which is considered to be one of the best Yugoslav silent films . In the 1920s several silent films were also produced in Belgrade; notably the film grotesque directed by K Novakovic) and the patriotic drama With Faith in God (1932, directed by M. A. Popovic) In Slovenia several films were made to popularize tourism. When sound was introduced , domestic production virtually ground to halt, and the were produced by American and German firms (for instance Love and Passion; 1932; The Vampire from the Mountain of Durmitor, 1932). After 1933, Yugoslav production was limited mainly to documentaries and reportage King

The era of the silent film witnessed the production of three episodes from Hašek's book: ruském zajétí Schweik in Russian captivity' , dir. Svatopluk dir. Gustav Machaty, 1927). Zlaty gold Cáp.

After 1925, Gustav Machaty was to play an important role in Czech cinema, and his enormously successful film Erotikon (1929) is generally considered to be pioneering work in the history of erotic cinema Four years later; he harked back to the poetic conception of Erotikon in Ecstasy (Extase, 1933) engaging foreign actors in the leading roles bathing naked in a pond was performed by the Viennese actress Hedy Kiesler (later Hedy Lamarr) was partnered by Aribert in the German, and Pierre in the French version, while the part of her husband was played by the Yugoslav Zvonimir Rogoz.

In the heyday ofthe silent cinema, the Czech film industry was producing between thirty and thirty-five feature films annually The first Czech sound film was released in February 1930, and thereafter the number of sound films increased steadily. In Czechoslovakia as elsewhere, audiences were hungry for sound films in their native tongue, and the Czech film industry; unlike the Yugoslav; was able to equip itself to supply them.

## Hungary

Dramatic political events in the immediate post-war years meant that Hungarian cinema followed a different course its neighbours. During the brief period of the Hung; industry was nationalized; this was the first time this had happened anywhere; preceding the Soviet Union by several months.A programme for the future development of national cinema was elaborated, but following the collapse of the Republic, it was never implemented. After 1919 Hungarian film production was checked, and output many talented film-makers and actors of   European Mischa Auer, and the theoretician of the cinema, Balázs . The decline in prO duction was partially compensated by the development of a Hungarian school of theoretical writing about the cinema. Forced into emigration, Balázs published one of the seminal works of early film theory, Der sichtbare mensch (The Visible Man) , in Germany in 1924. The following year; osztetikaja es dramturgaja (Aesthetics and Structure of Film Drama') which, however; remained largely unread outside his native Hungary It was some years before Hungarian flm production revived following the world-wide expansion of sound cinema. from

## Poland

In Poland there were many obstacles to the creation of a and market. Although the newly independent Polish State had a central administration, there and national differences between the former Russian, Prussian, and Austrian sectors. In the circumstances the State evinced no interest in the development of a nationwide film industry In the immediate post-war years up to 1922, the main emphasis was on the purchase of foreign films, and domestic production accounted only a small percentage of films shown on screen-twenty titles in 1922 The number of cinemas in this is estimated at 700 to 750, but only 400 were active seven week. for period days

Between 1923 and 1926 the crisis in Polish cinema deepened, hitting a record low in 1925 when only four films were produced, the main reason being that the State imposed exceptionally harsh financial conditions on potential film producers and cinema

Despite this unpromising situation most of the top ranking west European and American titles reached the Polish market, and Polish artists and intellectuals began to take a serious and systematic interest in film, seeing in it not only a form of popular entertainment; but a new form of artistic expression. Foremost among critics and writers about cinema in the 1920s were the poet and columnist Antoni Slonimski, Leon Trystan, and the art historian Stefania Zahorska. The literary critic and novelist Karol Irzykowski wrote The Tenth Muse: Aesthetic Problems of the Cinema (1924), a pioneering work on the of cinema that is still insufficiently known in Europe. theory

But this halcyon period (in terms of quantity if not the Eastern Front collapsed before the Red Army onslaught. The technical base of Hungarian cinema was totally devastated.

In the 1930s the Czechoslovak film industry underwent considerable expansion, with new studios and lab oratories created. In 1933 a modern production company was launched in Barrandow. Despite strong tendencies towards commercialization, film-makers such as JosefRovVávra and Hugo Haas, created works of original and innovative artistic merit that earned Czech cinema a foremost

position among the other countries ofeast central Europe. Internationalrecognition was notslow in coming.A group of films enjoyed international acclaim at the Venice Film Festival in 1934; Josef Rovensky's film 1933), a subtle tale about the tragic love of two teenagers; documentary about the Slovak countryside called Zem spieva (The earth sings' , 1933) by Karel Plicki; together with Machaty's Ecstasy; and the short Boure nad Tatrami ('Storm on the Tatras 1932) by Tomas Trnka. They were awarded the best set of films of high artistic merit, for direction and skill in presenting an original picture of nature. In 1936 Rovensky enjoyed another triumph in Venice with Marysa (1935), suggestive folk drama from southern Moravia based on the play by Alois and Vilem Mrstik. The folk was also awarded medal at this same festival, and two years later Otakar Vávra's Cech panien kutnohorskich ('Guild of the girls of Kutna Hora 1938) was likewise honoured in Venice\_ Cup

The mid-1930s saw a substantial increase in the number of films produced in Czechoslovakia-thirty-four in 1934, forty-nine in 1936, forty-one in 1938.By 1938 the Republic could boast 1,824 cinemas with 600,000 seats overall. After the signing of the Munich Pact number of film people; including Voskovec and Haas, emigrated abroad . However; far from reduced during the the technical production base of Czech cinema, like the Hungarian\_ underwent considerable expansion andmany artistic and auxiliary workers continued on in the industry throughout the war. The German occupation in Czechoslovakia was less brutal than in Poland or Russia, and this protected the production potential of the film industry. More than 100 feature films were produced by Czech studios during this period, with the Germans further expanding the modern production base in Barrandow in Prague. After the end of the war in 1945, Czechoslovak cinema was able to go into production without delay. being regime

The Warsaw firm Syrena Record was commissioned to create a sound-track using gramophone records In its early days the sound film in Poland frequently drew on existing cabaret forms, exploiting songs, sketches, and specific brand of humour. Pre-war Polish cabaret was on a par with the best revues in western Europe, s0 the sound film benefited from this symbiosis. Theatre and cabaret actors played an essential part in raising the standards of Polish film in the 1930s. Among the Polish film-makers Michal Waszyáski beat all records its

Although not much exported, Polish films of the 1930s enjoyed considerable international esteem and films by Lejtes and other Polish directors won prizes at Venice Production levels rose slowly throughout the decade fourteen films per year in 1932-4 to between twenty-three and twenty-six in 1936-8.

## THE 1930S AND SOCIALIST REALISM

At the end of the 1920s Soviet film enjoyed a well-deserved world-wide reputation, but within a short time the fame and influence of the great directors was lost; the golden age The coming of the sound film made the famous Russian montage" and therefore was a factor in the decline destroying the reputation of the Soviet cinema were the political changes that took place in the early 1930s.

From 1928 to 1932 the Soviet massive transformation, touching on all aspects of life. The changes introduced in the cultural sphere were and parcel of wider changes that included forcibly collectivizing the countryside, liquidating the kulaks, and attempting to build an industrial civilization in the shortest possible time.

Although inits golden age Soviet film was widely admired, the Stalinist leadership was dissatisfied. The Bolsheviks considered film tobe an excellent instrument for bringing their message to the people, and aimed to use it, more than any other artistic medium, for creating the 'new socialist man' These excessively high expectations to disappointment: films that were artistically successful and made in Communist spirit did not attract a large enough audience. The government wanted artistically worthwhile, commercially successful , It turned out that these requirements pointed in different directions and no filmmaker could possibly satisfy them all. they

The Cultural Revolution aimed to remedy what seemed fault to the Bolshevik leaders: the most interesting and experimental works from an artistic of view remained inaccessible to simple people. In order to make an attracted. Bolshevik policies brought about some of the desired results, and in the course of the 1930s film-going for the first time became part of the life of the average tainment, but the bulk of the people lived in villages. Now the peasantry was coerced to join collective farms and the collectives were pressured to 'projectors. Between 1928 and 1940 the number of installations quadrupled and the number of tickets sold tripled. point

Soviet industry was finally successful in producing its own aw film, projectors; and other equipment. Although the technical quality of Soviet production remained far behind the west, this was still a considerable achievement. The for simple ideas could, it was thought, be better conveyed with sound than with images. On the other hand, the technological burden of reorganizing the industry was great. Even as late as the Second World War the Soviet Union was forced to make silent versions of most films, because much of the country lacked sound projection equipment.

The choice available to film-goers greatly diminished. The import of foreign films, which had been very popular in the previous decade, dried to trickle. The number of domestically produced films also declined. Whereas in the late 1920s the industry had been producing between 120 and 140 films yearly, by 1933 output dropped to 35 and

Numerical decline went hand in hand with a reduction in stylistic variety; as the hand of the made began in the late 1920s and steadily intensified. Socialist Realism was declared to be the USSR's official artistic practice in 1934, but it derived from the politics of Cultural Revolution of 1928-32 Militant cultural organizations, notably RAPP (the Russian Association of for the suppression of all won Party support during much of the Cultural Revolution, but the Central Committee consolidated all literary organizations in 1932, thus effectively sup pressing the more militant factions like RAPP; and looked to long-range artistic policy that promised to support Soviet   development while remaining accessible and legible to the masses In so it promoted certain works which both conformed to conventions of mimetic fiction and provided clear social messages strengthening the Soviet system. This was as Socialist Realism heavy Party doing

Socialist Realism derived nineteenthcentury realism. Its 'transparent' style was considered an appropriate vessel for topical themes concerning socialism and Soviet development. Its tenets held that artists should infuse works with precise ideological formulations such as so-called partiinost (party spirit), the idea that the Party's leadership in social affairs should be affirmed at all times. from

the time Socialist Realism was formally adopted at the First All-Union Writers Conference in 1934, it had been madedoctrinal practicein all the arts application to cinema coincided with 'the process of bringing the films under central planning in line with other industries during the First Five Year Plan.

Although Socialist Realism as applied in the Soviet Union to models of literary and artistic realism, and purported to represent Soviet life in accordance with the reality of socialist development; it was very suspect form of realism. It can therefore also be seen in negative terms-not just for what it did, but for what it did not do. By replacing genuine realism with an appearhuman condition and the investigation of social issues: people were portrayed as they were supposed to and Soviet society was portrayed as successfully on the road to socialism. To put across this simplistic view; Socialist an absolute monopoly; for it world as it was. It therefore required political context in which it could be imposed forcibly. Socialist Realism is middlebrow, formulaic art, which excludes ambiguity; and experimentation.

Between 1933 and 1940 inclusive; Soviet studios made 308 films. Of these 54 were made for children, including some of the best films of the decade, such as Mark Donskoi's Gorky These films were didactic and aimed to educate children in the Communist spirit by showing, tries, their heroic struggle, and, most importantly and frequently; the importance of the collective\_ trilogy.

Historical spectacles became especially frequent in the increasing attention to rekindling   patriotism by old-fashioned appeals to national glory. These films were made about heroes such as Peter the Great, OI Marshal Suvorov, and were  often   shamelessly anachronistic: Pugachev and Stenka Razin, for example, two Marxist terms and before their executions consoling their followers by predicting the coming of a great and glorious revolution.

By contrast seventeen took place on a collective farm, many of them musical comedies-giving rise to the impression that life countryside was a never-ending round of dancing and singing.  Film-makers, and presumably audiences , liked exotic locales and many films were made about the exploits of explorers , geologists, and pilots; between 1938 and 1940 alone, eight films had as heroes. pilots

unbelievable plots. In the films, as in the confessions at thc show trials, the enemy carried out the most dastardly acts out of an unreasoned hatred for socialism. In more than half the films about contemporary life (fiftyoutofeighty-five) the hero unmasked hidden enemies who had committed criminal acts. The enemy turned out to be sometimes his best friend , sometimes his wife, and sometimes his father. ing

In 1940 a curious phenomenon occurred. Of the thirty films in that year with contemporary subjects, not one focused on traitors. The internal enemy disappeared and his place was taken by foreigners or their agents. The country was preparing to face foreign foe: instead of preached how the nations making up the Soviet Union must work together for the common good.

miserable\_ In this world people were starving to death, brutal police were repressing the Communist movement; and the ultimate concern of workers was the defence of the Soviet Union, the workers fatherland. recurring theme was foreigners coming to the USSR and finding there a rich and happy life. Twenty films were set outside the Soviet Union, the choice of locales varying with the twists and turns of Soviet foreign policy. Before 1935 an unnamed foreign country was usually portrayed . Ivan Pyrtook place in English, French, and German. Pudovkin's Deserter (Dezertir, 1933), where Germany was specified, not only did not then taken by the Comintern) depicted the Social Demo as the main enemies of the Communist workers. six anti-Nazi films were made, the best and most prominent of which were Professor Mamlok and Semia Oppenheim ('The see the Red Army brought a better life to Ukrainians and Belorussians , just liberated from supposed Polish oppression. how

Censorship aggravated the script famine, problem that had plagued Soviet Russian film from the earliest According to official doctrine, it was the scriptwriter, rather than the director, who was the crucial figure and ultimately responsible. Stalin thought that the director was merely a technician whose only task was to position the camera, following instructions already in the script. Publicists of the time insisted on the 'iron scenario' denounced the idea of directorial freedom as a remnant of formalism. It obviously made no sense to examine the script carefully at allow the director to make changes as he saw fit. A byproduct of this situation was that, while only a few directors lost their lives during the terror; a larger number of script-writers suffered this fate days. far

From the late 1930s until his death in 1953, Stalin became the supreme who personally saw and

approved every film released Like Goebbels in Nazi Germany, he micro-managed the cinema, changes in supporting favoured directors and actors, and reviewing scripts. In some politically sensitive films, such as Friedrich Ermler's The Great Citizen (Veliky could be regarded almost as a coauthor: On one occasion not only allowed comedy by Alexandrov to be shown but went to the trouble of ally choosing 'Shining Path' in preference to 'Cinderella' .

Through its insistence on making every film accessible even to the least literate, the obstacles put in the way of artistic experiment, and the denunciation of every trace ofindividual style as 'formalist' , the regime destroyed the talent of great artists It was often the most 'revolutionary' \_ the most 'leftist' artists who suffered the most. The wonderful originality of Vertov's, Dovzhenko's, and Pudovkin's talent gradually disappeared The formerly innovative team of Grigory Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg became   increasingly conservative Kuleshov stopped   making films. Even Eisenstein, whose individuality was indestructible, was forced to restrain his 'formalist' tendencies. When finally he was allowed to complete film, Alexander Nevsky; in 1938, his style had undergone significant changes, though his personality remained clearly visible

Film-makers contributed to the climateof denunciation by justifying it. In this respect, no prominent director with the exception ofKuleshov; who stopped making films after 1933, has a very record Eisenstein made his film Bezhin Meadow (Bezhin 1935-7) on the basis of story by Pavel Morozov; its purpose being to justify the son's betrayal ofhis father. In Dovzhenko's Aerograd (1935) a man shoots his friend because he turned out to be traitor. In Pyriev's Partiinyi bilet (Party card' ) , perhaps the single most distasteful film of the decade, the wife shoots her husband, who was the hidden enemy. Ermler's VstreGreat Citizen related the Stalinist version of the murder of Kirov and the great purge trials. (During the making of The Great Citizen four   people associated with it were arrested ) In a period of terror and confusion none ofthese directors seems to have actively tried to avoid involvement in making these films. Everyone was under threat if failed to conform and many were at least partially convinced of the rightness of what were good lug, they they

Necessity became the mother of invention Since it was impossible to make feature films with powerful propaganda content quickly, studios made short films and compiled them into collections. Anti-Nazi shorts were put into production straightaway; and the first collection appeared in cinemas on August 1941, with two more following later that month. Each consisted of a group of shorts, as few as two or as many as six. Numbers 1-5made up a series entitled Victory Will Be ours. Seven collections appeared in 1941 and five more in 1942, the last of them in August, by which time the practice could be discontinued as the relocated and reorganized industry could now produce full-length features. The content of the collections, known as kinosborniki, was extremely heterogeneous. included Allied documentaries such as one on the British navy and anotheron the air war over London; and excerpts from previously successful features such as Lyubov Orlo They

## THE GREAT PATRIOTIC WAR

The wartime Soviet cinema presents an irony. In every country cinema became more controlled by the State, and more heavily propagandistic. In the Soviet Union too; cinema was mobilized for the war effort, and the films

In June 1941 Hitler invaded the Soviet and German troops advanced rapidly towards Moscow. The leaders of the Soviet film industry dealt with the difficult situation to the best of their abilities and mobilized the industry with astonishing speed. They devoted most of their scarce resources to making documentaries and prevailed on leading directors to take on the task of editing newsreels. Studios changed the scenarios ofthose features that were already in production by adding war themes. was almost ready before the invasion, had to be remade Originally planned as a light comedy showing the lives of Soviet youth, its plot was changed so that in the new version, released in 1942, the hero gets his girl by exhibiting heroism in volunteering for the front. Some recently made films in circulation with anti-British OI anti-Polish themes were withdrawn, and Mikhail Romm's Mechta ('Dream'), which showed the cruelty of the Polish needed feature pre-war movies with   patriotic themes such as Peter the Great (Piotr pervy; 1937) and Dovzh enko's Shchors (1939) were revived. Particularly important was bitterly anti-German film which had been taken out of circulation Molotov-Ribbentrop pact happy ruling public

People craved movies: wanted to be taken away their everyday miseries; wanted they wanted their faith in ultimate victory to be confirmed\_ Film-going was one of the few remaining forms of entertainment. But in wartime conditions both making and they from they hope;

produced were obviously propaganda films. Nevertheless , given the immediate past and future of Soviet cinema, the period ofthe war appears now às an oasis of freedom. The regime allowed a measure of artistic experiment During the war film-makers engaged with subjects about which they cared deeply and expressed genuinely felt emotions .

## Alexander Dovzhenko

Alexander Dovzhenko is best remembered as cinema's great chronicler of the Ukrainian experience nomic and political development of his native Ukraine, and its accommodation to the modernization policies of the larger Soviet Union.

As long as the fighting continued, there was little desire to romanticize it. Instead of depicting the war as a series of heroic exploits, film-makers   preferred to show the barbaric behaviour of the Germans and the quiet heroism and loyalty of ordinary simple people in extraordinary cir-cumstances\_ The most memorable films of the period, therefore, dealt with the home front and with partisan warfare in German occupied territories \_

Three particularly memorable films were made about partisan warfare\_ The first of these Ermler's Ona zashchishchaet rodinu She defends the fatherland') appeared in theatres in 1943 It was artistically primitive\_ endowing its heroine with few individual characteristics and carrying the simplest political message: the necessity of vengeancewhich came out in January 1944 was more complex.

Films dealing with the home front also usually had women as protagonists; and extolled the same virtues of loyalty; endurance and selfsacrifice. Sergei Gerasimov's Bolshaya zemlya ('The great land') is typical in this respect, showing a woman who, after her husband's departure for an excellent worker in an evacuated factory.

As in the case of other combatant countries, vigilance was an important theme\_ Spy mania was obsessive. In the early war films everyone, including children and old women, unmasked spies In the short film V storozhevoi budke 'In the sentry box'). which came out in November 1941, Red Army soldiers uncover a German spy who speaks of Stalin.

## THE LAST YEARS OF STALIN

The end of the war did not lead to film-makers. On the contrary, in the autumn of 1946 the Stalinist leadership took steps to re-establish ideologica] control that had been loosened during the war The capricious demands of the authorities and their constani intervention in film-making became so oppressive thal the film industry almost ground to halt. During the worst years of the period\_often referred to as the time 01 film hunger\_Soviet studios produced fewer than ten films year; and some of the films made, such as Eisenstein's

Ivan the Terrible Part II (1946), were not shown until after Stalin's death. Studios stood idle and young directors had no opportunity to develop their talents. These were not only Soviet works but also the socalled 'trophy films'\_war booty taken from Germany by the Red Army. Between 1947 and 1949 approximately fifty of these makers were finding it impossible to live up to stringent political demands, recut and retitled Nazi and American popular; though they were never reviewed\_

The most famous example ofthe first genre was Mikhail Chiaureli's The Fall of Berlin (Padeniye Berlina, two parts, 1949-50). This represented the apogee of the Stalin cult. Chiaureli depicted the Soviet leader as supernatural figure, one who could see into the hearts of simple human whose very appearance was accompanied by the singing of angels. He was also military who not held off the Americans, who secretly sympathized with and helped the Nazis. Films in the propaganda genre were made to support some immediate of Soviet domestic or foreign policy. Abram Room's Court of Honour (1948) takes up the theme of the necessity for struggle 'rootless cosmopolitans' .

Just before Stàlin's death, however; Party leaders were beginning to recognize how barren Soviet culture had become were concerned that novels the Party, and tentatively took a few hesitant steps away from orthodoxy. G M. Malenkov devoted some of his speech at the Nineteenth Party Congress in October 1952 more films to be made and implicitly repudiating the previous   position of the leadership that insisted on making only 'masterpieces' As Mikhail Romm observed: 'To make few films turned out to be by no means easier than to make many. The idea that we must concentrate our attention on a few works (as ifin this way it would be possible to produce only excellent quality) turned out to be utopian\_ They

The decision to produce more films had far-reaching consequences.  Republican studios that had been neg lected could be revived; perspectives would open to young talents; studios would be able to stop concentra on disappeared could be resurrected. Malenkov expressed it: 'We need Soviet Gogols and Shchedrins, who with the fire of satire would eliminate everything negative, unpleasant, and dead, everything that slows down movement Conflict also needed to be reinwhich were widely recognized as stereotyped, schematic, and boring. It had, however; to be the 'right' type of conflict (e.g. between the remnants of the old and the new) leading to the right resolution (the victory of the new) What no critic could dare to say was that more courageous films could not be made so as put long

## Indian Cinema: Origins\_to\_Independence

India is one of the largest and most culturally varied countries in the world . Itis second only to China in population\_ and second only to the United States in the scale and importance of its film industry. Indian films are popular notonly in India itself, but in parts of Asia and Africa and in many other countries where there are communities of Indian descent. The roots of distinctive Indian cinema stretch back a long way and encompass variety of cultural traditions. While Bombay was and is, the main centre of Indian film production; film industries grew early in the century throughout the sub continent-in Calcutta, Madras, Lahore, and other major centres-basing their activity on theatrical and artistic modes which combined western and indigenous models. Out of this fusion sprang a number of genres such as the 'mythological' (based on Hindu myths and legends) which are unique to India. large

## THEATRE TO FILM: THE COLONIAL ENTERPRISE

It was also the place where the Indian film industry was born. The Kohinoor Film Company in Dadar; the Ranjit Movietone in Parel, and the Imperial Film Company adjoining today's Nana Chowk; the three largest studios India ever saw, flourished by the late 1920s within a few miles of each other. today Reay

then film, emerged as powerful economic class mainly through coastal trading with the west, Middle East, and

China. Many of the first shipping enterprises of Surat and Bombay were set up by Parsees, later the founders of the nationally famed genre of the Parsee theatre.

In Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, and Lahore, but also in other cities, this brand of theatre was exhibited in a series oftheatre palaces, usually ringed around the 'native' parts of town, in such a way as to be available to its richer clientele but also to keep its cultural distance them\_ In Bombay the Edward, the oldest surviving theatre in India; was built in 1860, and was followed by the Empire, the Gaiety (now Capitol) and the Royal Opera House. from

The Parsee theatre; often considered the direct ancestor to the song-dance-action stereotype of the Hindi cinema, established itself as an industry when Sir Jamsedjee Jee jeebhoy bought the Bombay Theatre in 1835. Jeejeebhoy was one of India's biggest trader-industrialists, with flourishing export business with China and Europe in silk, yarn, cotton, and handicrafts, and later the founder ofthe influential art Bombay Theatre had begun in 1776, built as straight copy of London's Drury Lane theatre and known, until School for Scandal and for its colonial British clientele. The combination established both a genre and an industry: Theatre was   followed even more famous Grant Road Theatre (1846) adapting local themes to the Elizabethan stage idiom. The romance drama, the 'mythological' , the 'historical' , and the adventure saga taken from popular Indian legendary tales such as Firdausi's tenth-century Shah Nama were accompanied by the first big adaptations of Shakespeare into Gujarati and Urdu. The music used was inspired by the opera to transform the popular north Indian musical, and thus to invent one of the ancestors of the early Hindi film song. they

## Exhibition

In its earliest days film exhibition was restricted to travelling tent theatres using the Edison and after 1907 the cinemas to be built while the famous theatre

palaces in major cities were converted en masse into 'bio scope' projection houses When the Lumière shorts were unveiled as the 'marvel of the century; the wonder of the world' , 7 July 1896, it was at Bombay's élite Watson's Hotel; but film then moved to the 'native' Novelty Theatre and the former premises of the city's most famous Parsee stage repertory, the Victoria Company. The Novelty was, even then, known forits doublepricing strategy to accommodate a 'lowerclass' audience in the stalls

Professor Stevenson exhibited A Panorama of The Flower of Persia at the Star Theatres, generating what for the next decade remained the dominant mode of exhibition in that city. Hiralal Sen (1866-1917), India's first filmed several   plays from the foremost commercial theatre groups in Calcutta, Star Theatres and Classic: he did Alibaba and the Forty Thieves in 1903 starring Classic's major attraction Kusum Kumari, who thus became India's first movie star. Most of his films were screened after the plays themselves as part of the evening's entertainment.

This trend is repeated in region after region. In Andhra tured in the first big movies in Telugu. In Madras leading roles were taken by playwright Pammal Sambandam Mudaliar; who did much to establish 'respectable' cinema in Tamil, and by the stage company (and later producer of Tamil sound films) TKS Brothers. In Karnataka, the Gubbi Veeranna Company and other theatre groups proliferated in the vicinity of Mysore; seat of the Wodeyar royalty; and later controlled the Kannada cinema well into the 1960s\_ provided all its key directors, like H L Leelavathi, and most of its early commercial hits: Bedara Kannappa (1953) for instance, the first big success in the Kannada cinema, adapted Gubbi Company stage play written by G.

## The Punjab

In Lahore, the cultural and economic capitalof the Punjab (now in Pakistan) 1901 saw two developments that were to transform the Indian entertainment industry The Ganthat for the first time made classical musical training available outside the feudal system of the guru and the shishya (disciple), causing a major revolution by publishing musical texts till now jealously guarded by various gharanas. It led to major spread of the music school system, throwing up most of the major stage musicians; and then singing stars like the Prabhat Studios' Shanta Apte, and, still more influentially, composers like Rafique Ghaznavi curtailing urban investment in agriculture led to large this took the form of theatre-building, first for the stage and then for film.

The Hindi 'masala movie in its current sense can trace its origins to Pancholi's musical successes Khazanchi (1941) and Zamindar (1942), followed by Kardar's Hindi films, followed in turn by one of the biggest producers of the 1960s-1970s, B.

## Madan Theatres

cantile élite is best demonstrated by the spectacular career of the controversial Madan Theatres, founded in Calcutta by Jamsedjee Framjee Madan (1856-1923) A former actor in the Bombay Parsee theatre, Madan caused business revolution when he   acquired the two   front-ranking Bombay companies Khatau-Alfred and Elphinstone, including their theatre premises, rights to all their pro ductions, their repertory of actors; and their writers. Shift-

ng his base to Calcutta, where he started J. F Madan & Co. in 1902, he initially ran the Elphinstone Theatrical Co., and his flagship theatre, the Corinthian. Much of his stage work of this time is exemplifed by his key in-house playwright Aga Hashr Kashmiri (1879-1935), best known his adaptations of Shakespeare into an indigenous version of orientalism: dramas of feudal blood-ties, battles for honour, sacrifice and destiny Kashmiri's influence persisted in Indian theatre and cinema well into the 1940s, Modi (Jailor, 1938) and Mehboob Khan (Humayun, 1945) for

Madan saw the cinematic 'crossover' potential of his own theatrical property relatively late in his spectacular career as an entrepreneur. He frst moved into film when he bought agency rights for Pathé, converting his own theatres into projection houses. He then went on acquiruntil at its peak the Madan distribution empire ran 172 theatres throughout the subcontinent and earned half the national boxoffice. As an importer, Madan bought films before the First World War mainly from British sources such as the London Film Company, but then in the 1920s got the prize contracts of Metro Pictures and United Artists\_ Madan was explicit in his marketing plan of catering to the Anglicized urban élite and for several years distributed hardly any Indian films. ing

This marketing strategy had several cultural resonances had taken advantage of wartime subsidies to build theatres for the entertainment of British troops. Earlier; the Parsee theatre's ideal of a self-respecting indigenous capitalist culture, evoking its own version of Victorian grandeur; had pioneered whole industry of bazaar art, including still photography and painting; aimed at a local 'westernized audience. The famous 'Company school' of painting was an influential, often highly innovative form ofbazaar art catering specifically to the British and Indian traits, and street scenes Oil painters commissioned by India's nobility to paint scenes of court splendour were gradually replaced first by still photographers and graphic artists and then by film crews hired from photographic companies   like Clifton & Co. in Bombay Or Bourne & and tea parties, and events of state Much of the first comes directly out of the 'Company-school' aesthetic on commissions from the Pathé Exchange; the International Newsreel Corporation; or Fox Films Co., who bought news footage at $2 per foot and 'review' films like F.B. Thanawala's Splendid New Views

By the time Madan Theatres moved into film production around 1917, the group's idea of updating the Parsee theatre's classicist aspirations came to mean very different politically from in the group's heyday a decade or things

In its first years, the Madan brand of orientalism was crucially determined by its key auteur, Aga Hashr Kashmiri\_ with star Patience Cooper playing an early version of Nargis: the exemplifying   kin honour; the site over which men fought their battles for domination In 1923 the company co-produced the sexually explicit Savitri with Cines of Rome Directed by Giorgio Mannini and featuring Italian stars Angelo Ferrari egend was advertised as a 'charming Hindu story \_ taken amid the world-renowned Cascades of Tivoli in Rome' . The company then hired Rina and her husband Giuseppe; and Italian cameraman (and later director) T. Marconi sizing the Italian connection as a way of boosting the classical ancestry of the operatic Parsee theatre and its film variations Then in 1932 Madan produced Sabha, one ofIndia's biggest sound films to date, featuring sixty-nine songs, and adapted from written in 1852 in Wajid Ali Shah's Avadh court, but now empha-

## Political resonances

By the 1920s, the idea of an indigenously manufactured culture; 'on a par with the west-which was to be the dominant refrain of the 1927-8 Indian Cinematograph Committee headed by Dewan Bahadur T. Rangachariar-had opened out into a new political era that of 'Swadeshi' . In 1918 the MontaguChelmsford Reforms\_ which allowed for the first time ticipation in government while calling for a revitalized lation on The 1918 Cinematograph licensing policy for film theatres\_ Municipal and police rules followed in 1920, stipulating that films be shown only in built-up premises , and asserting theneed for greater financial accountability on the part of distributors popular

In 1926 came the proposal for an Empire Films Corporation, British initiative meant to revive the British film industry by reserving compulsory screen time the 'Empire' . There was wide disagreement amongst Indian producers over this proposal: claim its share of the compulsory screen time and thus export to other countries in the Empire; while others argued that similar proposals in other industries had never worked in the past. It was only one set ofthe numerous arguments and dissensions, as the process of nationalist hegemony finally came of age in the cinema industry and cinema started to be acknowledged as the most influential of India's popular arts\_ for

Ganguly's successor was P.C. Barua (1903-51), one ofthe most famous directors in the pre-Independence period. Barua joined films as shareholder in Ganguly's British Dominion, before both Barua and Ganguly found employment in the biggest Indian studio of the 1930s, the New Theatres. There Barua's melancholy love stories, set amid nihilistic aristocracy and evoking feudal romance literature, used static, masklike actorial countenance counterposed by the most mobile subjective camera of his time in Indian film In his most famous melodramas, Devdas was devastating: The drowning his sorrows in liquor before he dies at his beloved's door to company with a wild elephant in the forest (Mukti) , were not only among the biggest hits of their time in Indian film, but opened up the richest avenue for assimilating into the mainstream the realism promoted by the Communist Party-affliated Indian Peoples' Theatre Association (IPTA) story keep yet

The influential Bengali director Dhiren Ganguly (1893 1978) was a leading supporter of Empire Films. Himself a product of the colonial academic art discipline; a portrait painter and photographer; Ganguly's photographic self portraits and his first big film Bilet Pherat (England Returned, 1921), along with his studios British Dominion and Indo British Film, translated into film well-established idiom of satirical literature, theatre, and popular painting that of the city's bhadralok (bureaucratic upper middle class). In its self-reflexivity; its ability simultaneously to view the translate into film the well-established production sectors of Bengali painting and theatre; Ganguly's work opened up the richest vein yet in the establishment of a culturally valid and economically successful cinema industry.

Barua's cameraman for both these films was Bimal who was later to direct the landmark Do Bigha Zameen (Two Acres of Land, 1953) with IPTA actor Balraj Sahni and Roy,

composer Salil Choudhury The story of a peasant forced to migrate to the city to repay debt and reclaim his ancestral 2 acres was a musical melodrama but also the Indian cinema's first concentrated assimilation of a new western influence ~the realism ofVittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves, shown in India's first international film festival in 1951.Barua's colleague Nitin Bose and disciple Hrishikesh Mukherjee were among those to create the genericcontext for the work of the country's greatest post-Independence auteurs: Satyajit Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak Ray,

## SWADESHI TO MELODRAMA: THE REFORM FILM

In 1895 the social reform movement in India entered a new phase when, in protest against the discriminatory cotton tariffs imposed by the British government; the Swadeshi movement was launched. Literally Swa-deshi ('owncountry'), it became in 1905 the major plank of the nascent Congress as a nationalist call to boycott all foreign manufactured goods. On the one side this was straightforward assertion that India had developed movement also claimed did not always mesh together; and from the outset the capitalist   ambitions of the traders and investors ran counter to Gandhi's view that Swadeshi industry had to see itself in radically different terms from colonial industry and concentrate, for instanceon rural uplift. These conflicts at the heart of the Swadeshi movement found powerful focus in the development of indigenous Indian cinema long Party

ownership, employees and stories are Swadeshi; wrote Dhundiraj Govind (Dadasaheb) Phalke (1870-1944). Phalke's first feature Raja Harishchandra (1913) is in all official history books seen as the birth ofthe Indian cinema industry (Phalke himselfmade the claim later), not only because it is the first full-length feature made in the country; but because of the inflection it gave to the idea of an 'Indian' sedjee Jeejeebhoy's JJ. School of Art, and he went on to become professional still photographer, set and printer. Then in revelation: 'While the Life of Christ was rolling fast before my eyes was mentally Could we the sons of India, ever be able to see Indian images on the screen?' Phalke, who started the Phalke Films Co. as cottage industry by converting his kitchen into a makeshift laboratory; later became a partner in the Hindustan Cinema financed by industrialist Mayashankar Bhatt. But he never got the sort ofmainstream financial that support

to the Bombay film industry. His work however; like that of Baburao Painter and the Maharashtra Prabhat Studios in Kolhapur; remained a crucial cultural standard exemp lifying the Swadeshi ideal and a measure for all the other claims to cultural and economic authenticity that fol-lowed\_

All the big studios in Bombay, established in the 1920s, Movietone, and, slightly later, the Sagar Film Company were all started through the expansion of the filmexhibition sector; all four had been established along the lines house star system and a production assembly line; and all were initially influenced largely by the coloniallorientalist stereotypes of Company-school painting and the Parsee theatre

## Imperial

The Imperial was established in 1926 by former exhibitor Ardeshir Irani. Renowned for having produced the country's first sound feature Alam Ara (1931), it had created the most famous was Sulochana Playing Theda Bara-style roles in films like Wildcat of Bombay (1927) and in costumed period movies like Anarkali (1928) Sulochana was also cast in 'realistic' films like The Telephone Girl and Typist Girl (both 1926) and the modernization melodrama Indira BA (1929) erated 'westernized" 'searing exposés' of Bombay's mercantile capital class in Manilal Joshi's Mojili Mumbai (The Slaves of Luxury; 1925) this realism translated its orientalist origins into kind of primitive frontier where the colonial-versusnationalist conflict could itself become quasi-period fantasy. This is most evident in the films of the Wadia Movietone (an offshoot of Imperial established in 1933), starring Fearless Nadia, an actress of Australian origin, who appeared in (Hunterwali, 1935; Miss Frontier Mail, 1936) as well as in Hindu mythologicals and melodramas with Shakespearian 1933, reputedly inspired by King Lear).

Indeed realism, at this time, developed via Phalke some of its most influential reference Inflected in the direction of indigenism in a combative cultural struggle around the Swadeshi debate its two major extensions remained until the late 1940s in the mythological and in the orientalist drama (including in this the Kashmiri-type costumed historical) The Kohinoor studio's début Bhakta Vidur (1921) starring its producer Dwarkadas Sampat; was on the surface a straightforward mythological, adapting dispute when it was banned by the on the

The prototypical social reform writer was the Bengali Saratchandra Chatterjee, whose novel Devdas, written in 1917, was the subject of several film versions, including that of Barua in 1935. Chatterjee dealt in more than half his writing with the condition of the widow This was in line with the reform programme call for widow remarand several other programmes addressing the condition of women neo-traditionalism, generating revenge sagas family riage, and

His early work for the Maharashtra Film Company was in the mythological genre and his films Seeta Swayamvar (1918) and Surekha Haran (1921) were much admired by nationalist leader B. G. Tilak, who apparently dubbed him 'Cinema Kesari' . But he extended the genre first into the historical, using legends featuring the Maratha royalty (Sinhagad, 1923; Baji Prabhu Deshpande, types through the process of equating the 'recognizable" in narrative traditions with generic context that designated them as specifically 'Indian'.

## The social reform novel

By the late 1920s the social reform novel had replaced the different brand of authenticity. Through the late nineteenth century the reform novel had established itself in several Indian lanKannada, Urdu, and Gujarati, effectively launching the first modernist movements in those regions and narrativizing aseries ofmutations of 'tradition' into a reformBy the 1920s it had established itselfin the popular literary mainstream, with the rise of literary journals, the short story, and serialized fiction, establishing range of literary stereotypes virtually waiting to be transformed into theatrical and cinematic language

## Nargis

(1929-1981)

Nargis is a major Hindi star associated principally with Raj Kapoor, with whom she acted insome of the most enduring melodramas of the Indian cinema in the 1950s. Born in Allahabad as Fatima A Rashid, she daughter of Jaddanbai, an actress, singer, and one ofthe earliest female film-makers in India. Nargis began ap under the name Baby Rani

Many of the Nargis 1950s melodramas were tragedies; s. U. Sunny's Babul (1950), Kidar Sharma's Jogan (1950), and above all Nitin s Deedar {1951), in which she plays the hero's childhood sweetheart, separated from him by dass inequalities. The hero (played by Dilip Kumar) goes blind and becomes an itinerant singer; but meets back Whenhediscovers that his benefactor ismarriedto Bose'

In 1947 she produced and starred Hashr Kashmiri, who had used the femme fatale sterco Nargis brought a degree of authenticity to the Arabian Nights-type fantasy that was unprecedented in the Indian cinema ofthe time.

In Independence melodrama, Andaz (1949). she was pivotal to Mehboob's attempt to merge She played Neeta, the westernized daughter ofan industrialist, who is in love with an infantile playboy (played by Raj Kapoor) However she is also friendly with a young and believes she reciprocates his feelings, but this leads manager dead and at the murder trial , reveals her fabeing

Nargis achieved superstardom with her second film with Raj Kapoor, the epic Awara (1951) If Mehboob lo cated her screen image at the crux between 'traditional' authenticity and capitalist modernity Kapoor brought a whole range of associations into his predominantly Oedipal melodramas In Awara Nargis plays a lawyerwho defends her childhood sweetheart in court after he kills his surrogate father. The intensity of the melodrama spills over into a kind of hallucinatory pictorialism, evident in theecstatic, soft-focus song duets the lead couple lowed byother hugely successful collaborations between tasiesa love story was mapped onto the class divisions of independent India; becoming the major dramatic pivot

Sagar's main claim to fame, however; was that it intro duced into the cinema the team of scenarist-directors Zia Sarhadi and Ramchandra Thakur; and their celebrated colleague Mehboob Khan. The careers of this trio Marxist fellow-travellers of the Indian Peoples' Theatre Association, were in the mid-1940s to take them to two other studios: Prabhat, with its major in-house star film-maker transition to a new generation of script-writers such as K A.

Shantaram and Prabhat

In 1933 when Prabhat to Kolhapur; cutting thereby their final umbilical cord with feudal resources, Shantaram's modernist aspirations also came to the fore That year the Marathi theatre had seen its first major avant-garde experiment; the naturalist play Andhalyanchi Shala, set to original music by Keshavrao Bhole, and featuring Keshavrao Date, the actor who transformed ralism. The infuence on the performance was that of Bernard Shaw, rather than Ibsen or Stanislavsky; and Shantaram initially wanted to adapt the entire play to film. This project failed, but he did manage to hire both Bhole and Date, and with them made his baroque drama Amritmanthan (1934), and the even more spectacular Kunku The Unexpected' , 1937). Both films were influenced by the German expressionist cinema and Kunku adapted a Kammerspiel strategy into a story about the rebellion ofa young woman (singing star Shanta Apte) forced into marrying an old man (Keshavrao Date) to most successful melodrama ever. moved prod

In 1931 Shantaram made Ayodhyecha Raja; a Mahabharata fable addressing the issue which was shot in starkly realistexpressionist style; notably in the sequences where the now employed in cremation ground, faces his wife with the order to execute her. His later 'saint film on Sant Eknath (Dharmatma, 1935) was also nationalist parable, promoting Gandhian arguments on caste key king,

Shantaram 's daring experiments with lighting and performance should be seen in the context of the extremely strong generic undertow of a nationalist; popular; industrially established, cultural neo-traditionalism that flourished in literature, theatre, and painting as well as in cinema. Shortly before Kunku, indeed, the Prabhat studio had converted the unpromising material of miracle laden saint film biography ofSant Tukaram (1936)into what classics of all time. Integrating the still mesmeric power of the proletarian saint's poetry and dance, performed by starkly realist narrative about social exploitation; the film performed what critic and film-maker Kumar Shahani refers to as the rarest of filmic phenomena, the apparently unmediated translation of belief into action: and Shahani places this film on par with Chaplin or the early Rossellini\_

Tamil and Telugu cinema

The intersection of pervasive neo-traditional popular art; the best-known cinema of the third (after Bombay and Calcutta)   production centre in the  country: Madras . Cinema effectively began here with R Natartaja Mudaliar; whose six mythologicals between 1916 and 1923 inaugurated what K Sivathamby suggests was a remarkable time in modern Tamil history an egalitarian audience regating audiences. Traditional Tamil élitism, continued into film by the Congress Party; was strongly opposed by producer-director K Subrahmanyam (1904-71). rahmanyam, credited with the first local production infrastructures in Madras and with the setting up of state bodies like the South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce moved away from mythologicals to make his best-known about a temple priest who joins the freedom struggle; and his daughter who abandons her unhappy marriage and her wealth to do the same was to have major cultural impact on Tamil cinema, spawning two contradictory but definitive movements On the one side his financier S. S. Vasan, who took over Subrahmanyam's studio to start Gemini Pictures, launched with Chandralekha (1948)a new aesthetic of mass entertainment that he himself dubbed 'pageants On the other; the influential separatist grouping Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), political party that won state power through film as its major medium of propaganda; also traced many of its devastatingly effective uses of melodramatic vention to Subrahmanyam's films.

Parasakthi (1952), the best known of the early films, included sensational sequences where the epitome of chaste womanhood is molested by a villainous temple priest inside a temple, forcing the to murder the priest in front of the and eventually propound his (and his party's) ideals in a courtroom. Numerous films have followed Tamil. for using grief hero deity

Although the DMK was not a national but a more specific Tamil subnational allegory for its family dramas; italso brought an intense degree of political awareness to the genre that most characterizes the post-Independence Indian cinema: the epic melodrama.

Rai imported, with Osten, his German and British crew; and with them established a studio that included in board of directors three of the over banks, insurance companies and investment trusts, occupy commanding positions in the industrial life of Bombay' (Ashoka Mehta, quoted in Desai 1948).

## China Before 1949

## CHRIS BERRY

Chinese cinema before the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949 was not only pre-revolutionary but also post-colonial. Primary source histories, written with the constraints of either Chinese Communist Party or Kuomintang Nationalist orthodoxy; and later works derived from them, have stressed the former and downplayed the latter. Yet it was precisely this paradox that animated the 'golden ages' of the 1930s and 1940s,which areclaimed as heritage by both the mainland and Taiwan-based governments.

Shanghai was the Chinese cinema capital throughout this period. The first film screening in China occurred there on 11 August 1896 as an act on variety show bill. A great cosmopolitan entrepôt at the mouth of the Yangtze, Shanghai's growth and development was entirely of east and west, and also the central nexus of exchange between them; the point where met, clashed, interthey

From Shanghai, the foreign cameramen-showmen fanned out the cinema to the other major littoral cities and the imperial flourished where foreign penetration was most complete; and foreign films and foreign distribution and exhibition networks dominated the industry.

An examination of its plot and the earliestsurviving film, Romance of a Fruit Pedlar (1922)indicates affinity between the cinema and the 'mandarin duck and butterfly' vernacular literature that also boomed in the cities at this time.

Two of the workers form comedic pairing that is at once modelled on Laurel and Hardy and the cross-talk, stand-up comedy teams of Chinese variety shows. The film has sound effects and music but no dialogue.

## The Classical Cinema in Japan

The Great Kanto Earthquake of the first of September 1923 destroyed Tokyo and the culture it had supported. The Japanese chose not to rebuild the as it had been and abandoned its old forms for a new appearance. The destruction caused by the earthquake also gave the decisive impetus for the development of new kinds of Japanese film. From 1924 to the early 1930s a number of classics of Japanese cinema were made at Nikkatsu, Shochiku, Teikine Makino, and some small independent studios Production and invention were stimulated as archaic forms were abandoned and film-makers embraced new European art cinemas. city

the New School genre These were influenced by German Expressionism, partially employing the contorted stage From Morn to Midnight (Von Morgens bis Mitternacht, 1920). Formula rather than had been the important factor in Japanese film-making since its inception, and German expressionist style could be incorporated very swiftly. Film-makers took the German imports as 'film art' template; a new formula to reproduce. Kenji Mizo guchi imitated the form in his Chi to rei 'Blood and Spirit' , Nikkatsu, 1923) completed just before the earthquake and one of the last to be made in Nikkatsu's famous Mukojima studio. story

Although the destruction caused by the earthquake was the decisive catalyst for these changes, they had been underway for several years before As early as 1922, such films as Reiko no wakare ('On the verge of spiritual light' , Kokkatsu/Kiyomatsu Hosoyama) and Yôjo no mai ( Dance of a sorceress'\_ Shochiku[Yoshinobu Ikeda) had appeared in

Gendaigeki was not the only form to change damentally after the earthquake. Even the Kyuha (Old School) genre, the most traditional costume drama, changed in this While very traditional films continued to be made, a new form developed from its roots and became known as period drama or jidaigeki. This genre too moved away from the repetition of formulas based on familiar and traditional stories.

Company; Shozo Makino had made many Matsunosuke Onoe films as specialist Old School director. However, in 1921 he founded his own independent company; Makino and began to make period dramas that differed in form style from the formula Matsunosuke Onoe films.

content, injecting a current of leftist ideology into the jidaigeki.

Nikkatsu studio continued to make orthodox jidaigeki. Tomiyasu Ikeda, the main jidaigeki director at the studio borrowed well-known and traditional historical stories, and so his films lacked the boldness of Makino's period films in which the heroes were always heading towards ruin. Ikeda directed large-scale static jidaigeki such as Sonno joi ('Revere the Emperor; expel the barbarians' , Nikkatsu, 1927) and Jiraika   gumi (Jiraika group' Nikkatsu, 1927-8), and he became the undisputed master ofthe most traditional jidaigeki from the late 1920s into the 1930s. However; not all of Nikkatsu's jidaigeki directors were content with making orthodox  period drama For   example Kichiro Tsuji conducted unique to hell' , Nikkatsu, 1926) was he even approached the proletarian cinema, making the masterpiece Kasahari kenpo (The umbrella swordsmanship' , as the Japanese socialist movement was suppressed by state and police evoked a feel period

The jidaigeki form, then, was continuously refined in the late 1920s, through the innovation of many directors in different production companies. The films contents were constituted not only from the traditional sword plays, but also from the ideas inspired by new ideologies. Daisuke Ito's jidaigeki of this described the period

The interfered with all tendency films, particularly cutting parts that represented the destruction of social order. It was impossible for films to admire revolution Or to suggest the legitimacy of Communism, and even the representation of the bare reality of poor people was prohibited. This meant that the degree of realism in these tendency films was weaker than that of their Soviet and German counterparts. Furthermore, to attract audiences the tendency films had to depend on sensationalist subject-matter; which limited the possibility of the ideo logical development ofthe film.

Despite these obstacles, sound films were produced in Japan from relatively early date. In 1925 Yoshizo Minagawa acquired the rights to Lee De Forest's Phonofilm and renamed several 1930, including Kenji Mizoguchi's first sound feature Furusato ('Hometown', Nikkatsu, 1930). In 1928 Masao that Tojo repro duced sound on discs, in similar manner to Vitaphone Using this system; sound films began to be made at the Nikkatsu and Teikinestudios.

Gosho. Although Shimazu did not develop such a personal style as some of his contemporaries, he made many largescale star-vehicles within the Shochiku studio system. He was often conservative in his direction, but he came to be considered one of the most trustworthy directors at Shochiku by making sensitive films such as Tonari no yae chan (The girl next door' 1934). Heinosuke Gosho was another of the more orthodox directors at Shochiku, and he was entrusted with the company's first two sound pictures. His personal cinematic style developed after the war, when his films began to display a tendency towards literary idealism, while his contemporary Naruse's postwar films were still very much in the Shochiku studio style

From the mid-1920s onwards makers ofjidaigeki were at the forefront of developing innovative forms of Japanese cinema. In the 1930s, two directors particularly became renowned for creating new age of jidaigeki.  Mansaku Itami directed nihilistic jidaigeki, making such films as Kokushi muso (1932) and Yamiuchi tosei ('The life of a foul murderer' , 1932). Sadao Yamanaka introduced elements of the gendaigeki (modern drama genre) into the jidaigeki. In addition to these two, Nikkatsu's director Tomu Uchida brought modern elements from his previous work to the sword film Adauchi senshu ('The revenge champion' Nikkatsu, 1931) The 1930s incorporated the ironical content and style of contemporary European cinema For example, Sadao Yamanaka's jidaigeki, Hyakuman-ryo no tsubo (The pot worth million ryo Nikkatsu, 1935) was directly inspired by René Clair's Le Million (1931)

Kenji Mizoguchi, who had developed many different themes in the course of his career; deployed his mastery as their setting In the mid-1930s his film-making methods in Naniwa erejii ('Osaka elegy' , Daiichi Eiga, 1936), Gion no kyodai 'Sisters ofthe Gion Daiichi Eiga, 1936), and Aienkyo ('The gorge between love and hate' , Shinko Kinema, 1937) heightened his fame as the maker of realist gendaigeki. This realism attained the highest stylistic beauty in Zangiku monogatari (The of the Last Chrysanthemums, Shochiku, 1939). In an uneasy atmosphere of nationalism and war, Mizoguchi escaped into the world of traditional Japanese beauty; a direction he would successfully pursue for most of the rest of his career. Story

In this situation it became difficult to make jidaigeki, as were based on traditional Japanese forms and took place in the past, and often appeared to promote fidelity to the feudalist system Thus the studios produced films for democratic education and films attacking past nationalistic tendencies.

## THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH

The First World War represents a watershed for Australian cinema as it does for the restofthe world.The war actually stimulated local feature production (Australasian broke its own house rule and made three features during 191415), but its aftermath saw what had been the (French) world film market become Hollywood's film market, to the detriment ofstable national film production and ultimately even to the combine's distribution and exhibition business . Culturally, however, this familiar situation was complicated by Australia's relation to Britain Inde pendent by 1901, Australia had none the less fought on England's behalf during the war as part of the British and glory provided the foundation to the motherland as ambivalent and conflicting as those provoked by Hollywood's hegemonic crassness and commercialism

For half a century Australian films remained resolutely, not to an art cinema existed in Australia during these years. Nor was there a serious Australian cinema of contemporary social issues until after the Second World War.At the same time, graphic or intense depictions of sex and violence, those flagrant markers of the 'liberty' of antiestablishment art as well as of the irredeemable commercialism of Hollywood, were absent in above-ground productions. Instead Australia tended to image itselfin a disarmingly tentative way as rough and ready society of innocence in which conventional class hierarchies were questioned, if not overthrown, and as place in which good people were sometimes able to survive the rigours of a hostile nature

These twin thematics were deployed with the greatest boxoffice success in another home grown genre, the backblocks farce. Like bushranging melodramas, these broad comedies of stereotyped rural families 'making a go' of farming enjoyed considerable popularity on stage before their first cinematic simulation by Beaumont Smith (Our

his cheap; quick productions contributed to the genre's vulgar reputation. The popularity of backblocks films had by the mid-1920s, but the genre was to a new gain waned

The high-point of Australian cinema for more than half century; and one of the most worthy films made anywhere before 1920, is Raymond Longford's The Sentimental Bloke (1919). Centred on an extraordinarily appealing performance by Arthur Tauchert as its lumpen protagonist, the film-which survives more or less intact today-is an adaptation of a popular series of poems and exclusively employs their versified modification of urban slang as intertitles If this were not remarkable enough, The Sentimental Bloke is narrated in the first person, certainly the most successful, ifnot the only; example ofsuch narration in silent cinema.

Longford who made films in close collaboration with his partner; Lotte Lyell, until she died in 1925, directed three sequels to The Sentimental Bloke and also contributed to the backblocks genre with two films based on stories by Steele Rudd which are apparently the original sources of the genre. Longford's aims were avowedly more serious and 'realistic" than those of most of his contemporaries, but it is difficult to judge whether these ambitions were matched by achievement on the level of The Sentimental Bloke , for of a lifetime's output of at least twentyone features only four survive in anything like complete state\_

and dubbed its distribution arm British Empire Films' , indicating both the expected source of the films it was to supply to its own Greater Union Theatres and the expected overseas market for its Cinesound feature productions:

Cinesound's films were and populist; like others which had been made in Australia since the beginof the century:   economically produced entertainment  designed to please ordinary Australian and British audiences\_ The company announced itselfby revivthe rural 'backblocks' genre which had proved so sucpopular theatrical version of On our Selection, written and played for broad farce and melodrama who had become synonymous with the character of Dad Rudd. Bailey continued to write and play Dad in the Dad and Dave series of backblocks farces for Cinesound until 1940 Cecil   Kellaway began his inter national career in Australia with performances in the same vein\_ popular ning ing

The foundation of Cinesound's production was its newsreel arm, which made use of locally produced sound techFox Movietone (which had shown the first Australian-made sound newsreel items in 1929), produced Australian news until television effectively shanghaied their market in the 1950s. From 1932, Cinesound also released at least two features year World War; all but one of them directed by Ken G who guided the company's feature production.

The Dad and films were modestly successful in the United Kingdom. This seems to have been generally true for other Cinesound   productions , which were melodramas and comedies often featuring minor English and American stars as well as Australian characters and settings. Until 1934 Cinesound's strongest local competition came from a company named Efftee, after the initials of its founder; Frank Thring. equipment and a full evening's programme (feature and suppor exploiting the resources of Australian theatre and music hall. Efftee then like Cinesound, attempted to identify itself as an alternative to what was commonly available playing on Hollywood 's presumed vulgarity and the shoddiness ofmany of the earliest sound films from the United States . Ironically, perhaps, Efftee's most astute move was to star the 'vulgar music hall comedian George Wallace in three films\_ After Efftee's demise, Wallace continued his film career at Cinesound, where his direct, sometimes balletic,   physical humour and sunnily simple characterization graced two more films, to the greatest sustained effect in Let George Do it (1938). Dave Thring

Efftee finally went under in the wake of the failure of the other states of Australia to follow the lead of New South Wales in imposing quotas on 'foreign', including

British, films. The introduction ofsound and an expanded market had promised to bring stability to Australian pro: duction; but, after a decade averaging five features a year this hope was obliterated by the combined effects of the Depression and the expense of cinema construction and a secure Australian feature production industry.

## POST-1940

The World War changed just as it had twentyfive years before. Charles Chauvel who had been making features independently since 1926, released his most an optimistic adventure based on the exploits of Australian Light Horsemen in the First World War; is still shown in the halls of the Returned and Services League around Australia. Chauvel's work, always aggressively nationalist and somewhat naïve and quirky, seemed to find a new confidence with the Second World War. With his wife Elsa as an often uncredited script-writer; he made four feature before 1945. The Chauvels went on to put their of the most accomplished Australian post-war films; Jedda (1956), a passionate and excessive racial melodrama which was the country's first colour feature; and an idiosyncratic tory, called Australian Walkabout (1957). things;

The Second World War also definitively destroyed what institutional stability Australian production had achieved in the 1930s with Cinesound Cinesound produced one allow Britain's Studios to establish production made a series ofidentifiably 'Australian the best known of which was to the future of Australian film-making was the socially committed attitude of the Australian films and Ealing Ealing

The war also brought newsreels back into prominence \_ Cinesound shut down its feature operation after 1940,and only five features were made during the war. However in Damien Parer; daring and accomplished camera operator, Australian wartime films happened upon a figure of near mythological proportions\_ Parer's news footage was exci and sometimes brutal. Kokoda Front Line, which he shot and narrated in 1942 won Australia its first Oscar\_ sharing the American Academy's first documentary awards with Ford's Battle of Midway, Capra's Prelude to and Varmalov and Kopalin's Moscow Strikes back.

## Cinema in Latin America

Moving pictures first reached Latin America with rep resentatives of the Lumière brothers, who sent out teams around the world on planned itineraries designed to capitalize on the fascination which the new invention created everywhere; two teams went to Latin America, one to Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, the other to Mexico and Havana The Lumière Cinématographe served as both projector and camera and men like Gabriel Veyre, who arrived in Mexico in the middle of 1896 and Cuba the following January; were also briefed to bring back scenes from the countries visited. Hard on their heels came the Biograph men from New York and other adventurers, from both the United States and Europe. The North Americans tended not to penetrate very far south, where European immigration and Brazil the pioneers were French and Belgian, Austrian and Italian. The earliest moving images of Latin America were thus mostly taken by European immigrants Or residents, possessing both the minimum expertise needed to set up a flm business and the contacts in the Old World to ensure supply of films for exhibition\_ The varying dates of these first films--1896 in Mexico, 1897 in Cuba, Peru-bespeak the steady penetration of film across the and they

The scenes that were shot follow the expected trends: families and entourages; military parades and naval manœuvres; traditional festivities and tourist scenes including views of architecture, picturesque landscapes, and pre Columbian ruins. The Brazilian film historian Salles Gomes (1980) reckoned that the work of the first Latin American cineastas was roughly divided between they city

In the condition of dependency which characterizes an underdeveloped continent like Latin America, this not only served to gratify the in Latin America was initially the upper and middle classes-with the cause of publicity. And if in Mexico newspapers sponsored free film shows which they financed by including an entertainment park commissioned the Cuban pioneer Enrique Díaz Quesada to make a film for its pub licity campaign in the United States.

The same dissimulation occurred during the as a school for filmmaking equivalent to the First World War in Europe. Aurelio de los Reyes (1983) reckons that around 1910-13 the skill of Mexican film-makers in structuring documentary narrative was in advance of the North Americans. North of the border the films inspired by Mexican events went from tales of arms smuggling (like Mexican Filibusters of 1911) to simerally extolled the superiority of white-skinned heroes among the violent, irresponsible; and treacherous Latin; whether bandit, revolutionary; or greaser. Such develop ments betray the patriotic populism, the thrall of the American Dream and its doctrine of 'manifest destiny' , in which North American cinema was gripped the very ideological servility which inevitably distorted their lensing of the Latin south. The assassination of Madero and the threat of US intervention not only promp ted a number of North American films clearly designed to justify US action on the grounds that Mexicans alone were their   country; but also drèw more North American cameras across the Rio Grande.

into a tropical appendage of Hollywood. Indeed, cashing in on the decline in European production due to the war; and following a general shift in US trade, from the end of 1915 onwards American firms adopted a new strategy of direct dealing by opening more subsidiaries outside Europe (and not only in Latin America) By 1919 Fox, Paramount, thedistribution arm ofFamous Players-Lasky, and Samuel Goldwyn were operating between them in virtually every Latin American country, displacing local distributors and local films. By the 1920s, Argentina and Brazil had become Hollywood's third and fourth largest export markets after Britain and Australia; in Brazil had an 80 per cent market share-while Brazilian prOduction itself could only manage 4 per cent\_ they

Given that these were indeed growing markets and that film-making was still artisanal and cheap, Brazil's peculiarity was that, while the vast size of the country prevented the national organization of film distribution, it allowed a number of regional centres of production to develop. There were 'regional in half a dozen provincial capitals, prominent among them Recife, where thir teen films were made in the course of eight years by like Tancredo Seabra's Filho sem mãe 1925), emerged one of the first indigenous fictional genres of Latin America, where landscape plays a preponderant role and the central protagonists are rural characters and cycles

The cangaçeiro is cousin to the Argentine gaucho film, which first appeared around 1915 with Nobleza gaucha ('Cowboy nobility'). Based on an episode from the popular nineteenth-century epic Martin Fierro by José Hernández, in which peasant girl is taken to Buenos Aires by the estate whom the patrón falsely accuses of cattle rustling, the story; says the Argentine film historian J. A. Mahieu (1966), may filmic rhythm is effective and its scenes of almost feudal exploitation make it the to portray the op pression of the rural classes in Argentina At just the moment when new European films were scarce and the North Americans had not captured the market, this film, which cost 20,000 pesos to make and earned more than 600.000, was major boxoffice hit showing theatres . As striking a demonstration as one could wish that Latin America could not only command its own narratives , but they had an import which gave the lie to the sanitized representations preferred by commercial and state interests. There was even, year later; anthropologist called Alcides Greca, El último malón ( The last Indian uprising'), which Mahieu describes as kind of documentary reconstruction of an uprising that took place at the beginning of the century; filmed in the authraped, from yet

But if these are isolated examples; they belong to an unknown history. It is history recently evoked by the Venezuelan director Alfredo J. Anzola in his feature docuThe mystery of the scarlet eyes' , 1993), which provides a are glimpse of previously unseen images of Venezuela in the 1920s and 1930s. The footage is that ofhis father; Edgar Anzola, who made documentaries and acquired a 16 mm. camera and filmed mostly documentary footage throughout the 1930s and 1940s. His efforts of the 1920s had not led him to viewing; they were the work ofan aficionado. Anzola earned his living as right-hand man to a local North American entrepreneur; who, among other Venezuela's first radio station, Radio Caracas, in 1930, of which Anzola became the director; a radio serial written and produced by Anzola père provides the title of his son's film about him\_ How many others among the all-butnameless Latin American film-makers of the early years had similar careers? And may have left undiscovered archives? And how many of these aficionados have not even left their names behind? And one other Anzola, as portrayed by his son, was clearly no intellectual, but he was keen cineaste who took his camera with him to events where he had entry as radio producer. The point of view is uncritical and marked by his social class. But aficionados of the same class in succeeding decades were the very people whose first film-making efforts represent the initial stirrings of the powerful new movement in Latin American cinema which emerged in the late 1950s. public thing:

## THE POST-WAR WORLD

## After the War

The Allied troops landed in Normandy in June 1944 Behind the troops came the para-military personnel of the American Psychological Warfare Branch (PWB), bearing films, mostly documentaries but also selection of features. Apart from a few smuggled in from Spain and other neutral countries, these were the first recent American these first films came the negotiators , Hollywood executives, some with military rank, preparing the way for resumption of the trade between America and economic objectives were inextricable. In their dealings with the former Axis powers, Germany, Italy, and Japan, the western Allies were concerned to eradicate traces of Fascism from their and to ensure that resurgent film industries in those countries did not perpetuate the ideologies that had brought the world destruction. But the Americans were also keen to ensure that when trade was resumed it would be on free-market without return to the protectionism that had marked the European response to Hollywood penetration in the 1930s-

reconstructing the devastated film industries in the defeated countries was entrusted to specialist commissions, part military and part civilian. In Germany, Erich Pommer played prominent role, while in Italy Alexander Mackendrick, then with the PWB, and Stephen Pallos , colleague of Alexander Korda, were brought on to the film commission. But reconstruction was not the chairman of the Allied Film Board, the American Admiral Stone, roundly declared that Italy; as a rural and former Fascist country; did not need film industry and should to have one His fellow Americans concurred, but the British did not, seeing it as transparent hegemony with five-year   backlog of films (including Gone with the Wind and Citizen Kane) waiting to be unloaded on the European market, this was indeed what the Americans had in mind

It was not only the American companies, but European audiences as well, who wanted Hollywood films back on the screen. A conflict soon emerged in many European

countries between the exhibitors, sensitive to public demand, and film-makers and producers, eager to establish a new cinema in the climate of cultural renewal after the war and the fall of Fascism. Governments for their part were anxious tolimit imports and protect the balance But the Americans were adamant. The Motion Picture Export Association was supported by its government. films were to be freely traded commodities like any other and trade in films was written into the GATT agreement and the prep arations for the Marshall Plan . who needed American aid more than the marginal improve ment to the balance of payments obtained from import restrictions were forced to capitulate, securing only modest concessions to protect the rebirth of their industries.

their response to the changed post-war situation. Britain, Michael Balcon at Studios pursued a policy of making films 'projecting Britain and the British character' that can be seen as a continuation of Ealing' wartime patriotism. Although traditionalist in their values, the films of the 1940s and early 1950s, particularly the comedies, reflected the political mood that had brought rebellion against austerity that brought Churchill back in 1951.

In Italy, however; a more original cinema emerged, in the form of neo-realism\_ With the main studios at Cinecittà temporarily in use as refugee camp, film-makers took to the streets and conditions and the will for change The neo-realist cinema had to compete in the market with the flood of American films that entered the country from 1946, and with other home-grown genres-especially comedies and sentimental melodramas-which were often patchy; and the generally leftish stance of the films (and the public pronouncements of their makers) did not find favour with the rightofcentre government that came to Italy; its ideas began to be picked up elsewhere; not only in Europe but also; and especially; in Latin America and India; where its directness of expression and simplicity of means had more relevant application, probably, than in itself. genera power

was conceived very within national-or 'national-popular'\_perspective. But the economic and political reality of Europe demanded a broader approach. The first steps in this direction were taken with the signature of Franco-Italian   agreement on bilateral agreements, opening up the market to Europewide coproduction, followed later in the decade. At first these agreements were treated as little more than expedients, giving easier access to foreign markets to films which in content were far less international than, for example, the multilinguals ofthe early sound period . But ambitious producers , particularly in France and Italy; soon realized that a market could be created for big-budget productions for international release\_ These films were also dubbed into, and occasionally shot in, English, in the (not often realized) of breaking into the more inward-looking American and British markets, and American stars were imported to increase their boxoffice appeal. Italian producers in particular began to look across the Atlantic for markets and sources of investment For their part, American companies , frustrated by the difficulty of reparevenues and attracted labour costs and the of talent existing in Europe, began to invest in European production. much hope pool

A pioneering role in the new internationalism was played by Roberto Rossellini. In 1947, before the first European agreements were signed, he had made Germany Year Zero (Germania anno zero), set in war-devastated Berlin but

Stromboli starred Ingrid Bergman then major boxoffice attraction in both America and Europe, and was shot in English (with the aid of the dubious expedient ofimagining that many of the island's America and so the language) But the film was not a success affair with Rossellini during the making of the film, coupled with the fact that on screen she was represented as leaving her husband meant that it fell foulofAmerican moralism and the Production Code The studio cut the film to pieces, and released it without fanfares. Rossellini made four more films with Bergman, now his wife, exploring themes of cultural difference between northern and southern Europe\_ These films, in particular Viaggio ín Italia ('Journey to Italy' , 1954), were notable for their spontaneity and freedom of expression and were to have great influence on the French New Wave of the early 1960s, but they did badly at the boxoffice; and Rossellini's precocious experiment of making films for the English-speaking market proved a failure. spoke

The new pattern of international   co-production was mainly confined to Italy, France, West Germany; and (from the ican imports, most did so own home market alone. France and Italy were the most successful exporting countries. Italy had thriving export trade with the eastern Mediterranean, while in the Far East Hong Kong increasingly became the film-producing centre for the Chinese diaspora. Britain and Scandinavia remained aloof from European developments. Neither Denmark nor Sweden ever regained the international role they enjoyed in the silent period. Heavily protected by the government, however, Swedish cinema maintained a strong production

Other examples were more successful. With Senso (1954, released in Britain as The Wanton Countess) , Luchino Visconti showed that it was possible to make a film for international audiences which nevertheless had a distinct national content. At one level sumptuous melodrama, Senso was politically radical and, in Marxist terms, realist in its denunciation of the opportunism and compromise underlying the of Italian national unity In France, Jean Renoir profited from Italian co-production finance for his the 1950s, The Golden Coach (La carrozza d'oro 1953), French Cancan (1955), and Éléna et les hommes Éléna and men 1956). And Max Ophuls made Madame de (1953) in Paris as Franco-Italian   co-production; and then went to Munich to make the spectacular Lola Montès (1955) in colour and CinemaScope, with an international cast, as German-French co-production. myth

## Luchino Visconti

(1906-1976)

Born in Milan to a family that was both aristocratic (on his father's side) and very rich (on his mother's), Luchino Visconti was drawn to the cinema and to an involvement when fashion Chanel introduced him to Jean Renoir in 1935. After a short whileworking with Renoirin the Franceof the challenge to the offcial culture of the period and was widely hailed, on its release after the war, as a precursor of neorealism. In 1948 he made the mammoth La terra trema, an epic about a Sicilian fishing family, loosely inspired by Giovanni Verga's classic novel I Malavoglia. Pop

If Ossessione was precocious forerunner of neorealism, La terra trema equally surely outran it. Shot on location, with non-professional actors speaking their own in incomprehensible dialect, terra trema emerged, paradoxically, as closer in style to grand opera than to the documentary realism it originally aspired to. With Senso (1954}, his first ûilm in Technicolor, Visconti was given the briefofmakinga film that wouldbe 'aspecand counter-betrayal, in which personal and political are

In Italy Cinema and Bianco e nero (both founded before the war) had an important role in the development of neo-realism. In France Cahiers du Jacques Doniol-Valcroze) was to be equally important in preparing the way for the New Wave, while in Britain Sequence (founded by Lindsay Anderson and Peter Ericsson in 1947) played similar role for its short-lived British equivalent.

Without question the most original thinker among the influenced by phenomenology; Bazin expounded a theory of cinematic realism explicitly opposed to the Marxist notions that had wide currency elsewhere in the culture He saw in the long take and the use of depth of field to permit multiple action to take place in frontofthe camera an opportunity for reality to express itself without the need for montage Or He praised the sober classicism of directors such as John Ford and William Wyler, but also; and especially; the attempts by the Italian neo-realists (notably Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica) to simplify film technique to the point where mise-en-scène hardly existed and the reality of events spoke

Cahiers du cinéma and Sequence in particular were militant magazines, expressing the ambitions of their writers (François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Rivette, and others on Cahiers; Anderson, Karel Reisz, and Tony Richardson on Sequence) shared with other magazines   (Positif  in France Filmkritik in Germany) hostility to the runof-the-mill no means sohostile to Hollywood. Indeed Cahiers du cinéma is best remembered for its   pantheon of Hollywood auteurs-with Hitchcock and Hawks at the top, followed by Orson Welles, Otto Preminger, Anthony Mann, Nicholas Ray; Sam Fuller; and many others not always highly rated the Cahiers critics mostly prized was individuality; but were prepared to find it in genre films and even in B pictures, as well as in the work of more obvious artists like Welles or Ford. They also admired Rossellini, Ingmar Bergman, and Kenji Mizoguchi, and, among French directors, Jacques Becker, Renoir; and Ophuls. They they

Even before his death in 1958 at the age of 40, Bazin had lost his steadying influence over Cahiers du cinéma. the dominating tendency on the magazine became that of the politique des auteurs associated with the name of François Truffaut. It was the ideas of the politique (which in its crudest form stated that only directors could make films and directors only made films) that were to be influential in film criticism outside France when taken up by the good good good

contemporary experience of Italian neo realism, a wider experience of cinema was provided for specialist audiences by the activities of festivals and cinematheques A Particularly important role was played in France by the Cinémathèque Française, started by the collector Henri Langlois in 1936. The Cinémathèque was not the world's first film archive (that honour should probably go to Britain's 1935). But it, with New York's Museum of Modern Art, whose regular programme of film screenings began in 1939, was the first to pursue vigorous policy of showing films of all types to public of enthusiasts MOMA and the Cinémathèque Française were followed; after the war; by the London Telekinema (later to become the National Film Theatre)  which opened in 1951, the year of the Festival of other European countries; whose programming stretched both backwards into the history of cinema and outwards to developments throughout the world\_ along

The result of these various   procedures was dif vertically. Smaller countries often enjoyed the most varied cultures. Domestic production would account for only 15 Or 20 per cent of the market, the rest taken up by films from other European countries and America. At the up by British or American films, with few European films receiving commercial release (and even that quite restricted), while a wider experience of cinema was conitself the situation was even more extreme; but the existence of ethnic markets meant that there was room for some imports from Europe and the Far East:) In between stood countries like France; which retained a strong industry competing with Hollywood for mainstream audiences but also imported films widely for different types of release being

## ECONOMIC PROTECTION AND CULTURAL IDENTITY

The struggles over free trade in films in the immediate post-war years produced stand-off. All European countries enacted protectionist measures of one kind Or as more than protection was economic What was protected was an industry and opportunities for profitand employment; lurked another motivation, which was cultural.  Negatively this took the form of thinly disguised antiAmericanism, exacerbated by the presence in Europe of the United States as (benevolent) occupying ized Americanization of culture  ('colonizing our subhowever, it was   felt that  cinema was an important expression of national and other forms of National cinemas embodied national traditions and spoke for national concerns; potentially, too, revitalized national cinemas could speak for social groups and interbeing

Festivals were also important in the shaping of an international film culture after the war. The Cannes Film Fesfilms. But for while Venice was more significant internationally. Founded in the early 1930s the Venice Festival had been discredited at the end of the decade by its association with axis' . Revived after the it not only   promoted Italian cinema (Visconti's La terra trema ('The earth shakes" was shown there in its complete form in 1948, to great acclaim) but provided European audiences with their first opportunity Lion première in Cannes in 1956,though only after a successful run in the United States, where it had won an Oscar for earlier that year.

ests under-represented either in Hollywood or in the mainstream of European cinema itself.

Three sorts of argument therefore came to be deployed in the defence of national cinemas against Hollywood domination: the straightforwardly economic; the national-cultural; and the new cinema' argument, whose national rhetoric masked more urgent concern for change. Economic arguments tended to be the most persuasive-though it was well known that wholesale pro tection for an industry in the form of tariffs and quotas ran the risk of retaliation from the Americans, as well as to make headway at the end of the was realized that more limited form of support for 'art" and 'quality' could satisfy cultural aspirations without negative economic effects. When De Gaulle returned to power in 1958, with André Malraux as his Minister for Culture; the French governmentinstituted anewsystem ofsupportfor the cinema, designed toencourage quality films which had at least a reasonable chance of box office returns Although intended to shore up the values in the cinema, the new system proved particularly beneficialto producers willingtobacktheyoungandiconoclastic film-makers of the emerging New Wave\_

Selective forms of government support were also to play Germany\_and indeed in countries throughout the world where the cinema was regarded as national cultural asset. Of the main film-producing nations, Britain alone persisted in mechanically redistributing proportion of exhibitors revenue from all films to 'British' producers on the sole criterion of box-office success. When first introduced in the late 1940s, the 'Eady as it was called, had seemed quite ingenious and painless way of supporting the sort of British cinena that existed at the time By the end of the 1950s, however, that cinema was crumbling. By persisting with the and rejecting culturally based calls for selective support for new enterprise; the government discouraged the growth of new British cinema and helped turn Britain into Hollywood's bargain basement. levy'

## Transformation of the Hollyood\_System

## DOUGLAS GOMERY

In the years after the Second World War, the Hollywood film industry underwent major transformation. Increased competition from foreign films, the decline of cinema audiences and attacks on the studio structure by government agencies led to crippled the American industry; and forced it into rapid began in the late 1940s when audiences at US movie houses began to fall. By the early 1960s were half what had been during the glory days, and thousands they they

This decline cannot simply be blamed on the rise of television; as it began five years before television existed as a viable alternative to movie-going. After the Second World War there was a demographic and cultural shift in urban America that profoundly altered the leisure patterns of US society. People were bonds accumulated during the war and buying houses in ofthe century This took away the demographic heart turn

the cost of going out to the movies; upon relocation it became inconvenient and expensive to travel to the centre of town simply to see a film.

The Hollywood studios were not oblivious to these trends saw the need to provide new suburban theatres, and, once the necessary building materials became available, began the process of constructing 4,000 driveins throughout the USA. The drive-in theatre offered pleasant, open space where movie fans in parked cars could watch double features on massive screen. By June 1956, at the very height of suburbanization and the babyboom, for the first time more people in the USA went to the drive-ins than to traditional hard-top' theatres They

A more permanent solution arrived with the shopping centre theatre As new malls opened in record numbers during the 1960s\_ the locus of movie attendance permanently shifted\_ With acres of free parking and ideal access for the car; shopping centres generally included multiplex with five or more screens.

The shift of movie houses out of town centres and into the suburbs where the audience was now located did

## CHANGES IN PRODUCTION

Hollywood looked to innovation and new technology to tempt patrons back to the theatres. Films were designed on spectacular scale, clearly superior to the black and white video images broadcast into the home. The first of the 'new' film technologies, colour, had been availthe screen in Gone with the Wind, but throughout early years had only been employed select group of features, principally historical and lavish musicals. In 1950 Technicolor lost its market monopoly as a result of into the market, introducing Eastman Color; which required   only one, not The studios brought out Eastman Color under variety of movies were made in colour. long its for epics being

In 1952 the Hollywood studios went one step further, and made their movies bigger. Cinerama offered spec-

tacular widescreen effects by melding images from three synchronized projectors on a vast curved screen To add to the sense of overwhelming reality; it also included multi-track stereo sound\_ However, theatres which contracted for the new process were required to employ three full-time projectionists and invest thousands of dollars in new for most.

refusing to sell or rent feature films to the small screen\_ However; minor movie companies, always looking for easy profits, did offer their wares. In 1951, for example, Columbia Pictures established Screen Gems as wholly owned subsidiary to proffer filmed material to TV. The smaller Hollywood studios also rented their back lots to fledgeling TV producers , and unemployed film actors and craftspeople took up television work

The process for creating 3-D effects had been around since the 1920s.In 1952 Milton Gunzburg and Arch Oboler launched Bwana Devil, African adventure story starring Robert Stack. The narrative and stars may not lion in your lap' , caused stir. During 1953 and into 1954, 3-D was hailed as the saviour of the Hollywood film industry; and the studios rapidly produced their own versions to ensure that were not left behind. Warners House ofWax (1953) and classic genre fare followed: MGMs musical Kiss me Kate (1953), Columbia's crime tale Man in the Dark (1953), and Universal's science-fiction feature The Creature from the Black Lagoon (1954). However; the complication of special 3-D attachments to projectors, and the inconvenience of the glasses which had to be issued to patrons , meant extra expense that was never fully matched by the extra take at the box office they

By the end of 1953 every major studio, except for Paramount with its rival VistaVision process, had jumped on the CinemaScope bandwagon. Within ayear halfthe theatres in the USA were showing CinemaScope, but again equipping theatres proved more expensive than had been anticipated and profits were difficult to maintain.

What the Hollywood studios needed was a widescreen process without the added complications of 3-D, prohibitive investment of Cinerama. Fox's CinemaScope seemed the answer; widescreen process which used an anamorphic lens to expand the size of the image. The first CinemaScope film, The Robe (1953), an overblown biblical tale, starring Richard Burton and Jean Simmons, dazzled audiences and a rosy future seemed in sight.

Other processes were tried, and rejected,  including Todd-AO for Oklahoma! (1955) and Around the World in Eighty Days (1956). The long-term solution to widescreen images eventually came from the Panavision Company. Robert Gottshalk perfected anamorphic projection attachments that   permitted flexible   filming and little   additional expense for the theatre owner. One could summon up a variety of anamorphic power with a simple turn of a knob. By the late 1960s Panavision had become the industry standard

## THE PACT WITH TELEVISÏON

Throughout this period of transition in Hollywood the major studios had stonewalled the television industry,

The first feature films shown on US television from abroad, the bulk from struggling British film studios like Rank, and Korda. Unable to break into the atrical exhibition in the USA, and unwilling to release their product for TV screening at home, the British capitalized on American television's eagerness to show any available filmed entertainment Ealing,

It was eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes, owner of RKO, who broke the log jam and sold RKO's film library to TVin 1954. Millions of dollars were made in this deal, and this impressed even the most recalcitrant movie mogul. In the next two years, all the remaining major Hollywood companies released their   pre-1948 titles to television (These titles did not require the payment of residuals to audience at its leisure, a broad section of the best and worst of Hollywood talkies .

From this point on, black and white films functioned as the mainstay of innumerable 'Early Shows' , 'Late Shows' and A decade later more than were aired each week on New York television stations.

In 1955 the majors   plunged ahead into producing specifically for television Warner Bros. led the way with scripts and films the studio already owned. Almost overnight, Hollywood replaced New York as the centre of television production; and by 1960 film companies supplied the majority of prime-time fare, TV series to feature films shown every night of the week. from

## THE FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL

The new economic conditions in the 1950s could not be faced simply by moving into television production; major changes in the structure of the studios were also inevi-table\_

The studios also readjusted by shedding their in-house production lines. The talent that had been kept on the books during the classical era now proved too expensive and independent producers were contracted in to make features . markets also became increasingly and the studios concentrated more on distributing their films around the world. These changes ensured the survival of all the major Hollywood studios, except RKO. However, in the ups and downs of the transformation, the studios

Columbia, like Universal and Artists , did not own string of theatres; and so was less affected by the changes of the 1950s.

This success continued into the 1960s\_ Abe Schneider and Leo Jaffe succeeded Harry and Jack Seasons (1966), Guess who's Coming to Dinner (1967), To Sir, with Funny Gírl (1968). As well as working with established filmmakers, Columbia found hits in unexpected places\_ In 1969 it released Rider, which cost less than half million dollars, and made stars of Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, and Peter Fonda. The lack of rigid, vertically integrated studio structure had been disadvantageous to Columbia in the 1930s, but proved to be the way to make millions in the new Hollywood systemEasy

The one new major Hollywood player to emerge during this period was the Walt Disney Corporation. This studio had existed on the fringes of the film industry since the 1920s, specializing in animation, but in 1953 formed its own distribution arm, Buena Vista. To feed this Leagues under the Sea (1954) and Mary Poppins (1964), as well as regularly releasing (and rereleasing) such classics as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1938) and Pinocchio (1940)

## THE PRODUCT

Young people, the baby-boomers, came to dominate the theatrical audience during this era; and consequently, their expectations and desires increasingly influenced the types of films released\_ To broaden its audience base, Hollywood loosened and reorganized its censorship standards; in November 1968 the United States became the last major western nation to institute some kind of systematic age classification of motion pictures; with the 'G', 'PG' 'R', and 'X' ratings.

The new economic order in Hollywood did not mean Genres changed, new film-makers entered the system, and Hollywood moved from studio to independent production, but the story-telling form of the films remained much the same. Hollywood took on more daring themes, but crafted them in the classical style. The director was now touted as an artist, identified and praised as the centre ofthe creative process, and, in general, film-makers were involved. However, the economic basis of the Hollywood industry remained the regular production of genre films, those most easily sold on a mass scale around the world they

Television did alter the way Hollywood made movies, in aesthetic, as well as institutional terms. In the 1960s, after it became clear that television was major market for features,   flm-making was forced to become  visually simpler. The centre of the frame (for both widescreen and standard ratio) became the focus of all but the least important narrative actions; so that it could be seen on television rebroadcast. The classical Hollywood cinema, which had been created to offer a narrative flow without interruption; had to learn to accommodate an audience's casual use ofTV, and the breaks demanded by advertisers

Stories were located in real settings and dealt with the contemporary (often psychological) problems of confused, ambivalent, and alienated characters. Whereas characters in the classical Hollywood cinema had to be well rounded, operating with clear-cut motives and characteristics the European influence allowed for the possibility of confused characters, without obvious goals. At the same time strict rules on continuity editing were relaxed and jump cuts gave a new look to comedies and sequences of violence

## Independents and\_Mavericks

The Hollywood studio system in its heyday was much admired abroad both for efficiency and quality of product and for its to match supply and demand. Other national industries did their best to copy it, hoping to strength and competitiveness from its tight industrial organization and forms of market control\_ From the late 1940s onwards, however; the complex structure developed in the 1920s and 1930s was beginning to fall apart. This was world-wide phenomenon, though the causes were not everywhere the same. and Italy; for example; it was an effect of the dismantling of the statecontrolled structures of the Fascist period . In India it came about as one of the many consequences of Independence and the arrival ofa new entrepreneurial class. In America itself the causes were complex. One pillar of the system\_ exhibition, which provided crucial  linkage between supply and demand, had been knocked out by anti-trust legislation confirmed by the Paramount case in 1948. On the demand side audiences were falling, while on the supply   side the smooth mechanisms for   harnessing creative talent to audience-oriented   production were showing severe signs of strain as artists at all levels rebelled being made cogs in the studio machine ability gain against

Even if the causes were different, the results were the change in the pattern of production and a greater independence of film-makers from; or within, the system which both nurtured and confined them. This was appar ent not only in much quoted pullulation of neorealism and its offshoots but even in of devolving production to independent units, and in Hollywood itself:

Contested and much derided though it was, the classic Hollywood production system\_ with its minute division of labour; had in the 1930s produced impressive results on the creative as well as the industrial side Individual creativity sometimes appeared to be suppressed, but it could also be fostered, as the careers of many great artists showed Comedy flourished especially well under the studio system-and indeed not only in Hollywood but in other countries as well.

It was always recognized by the studios that comedy could notbe produced to order But comedy also thrives on formula, and finding and sustaining a successful formula was exactly what the studios were best at. In the early sound years Paramount in particular had a whole stable

The studio system also provided a favourable environment for the growth of other formula-dependent genres, such as the Western and horror film. But it was suspicious of films which sought to get away from formula and were therefore regarded as a market risk, and its strict division writer or the director insisted (for whatever reason) on high degree of creative control crossing the boundaries between specialities Writers and directors with clout could get round the restrictions, sometimes by becoming their own producers. Howard Hawks, for   example directed few films for independent   producers Samuel Goldwyn or David 0. Selznick but otherwise produced most of his films himself from Tiger Shark (1932) onwards, and consequently enjoyed degree of creative control denied to the majority of contract directors.

## LOOSENING THE BONDS OF THE SYSTEM

In the 1940s there was a general loosening of the bonds that tied the system Producers , directors, writers, and actors found working in the studio context increasingly irksome The studio managements for their part found it harder to exercise the smooth control that had characterized the system in its heyday: Gaps grew up in the interstices of the system While the studios struggled to find new formulas with which to retain an audience which was dwindling year by year, the American machine produced films, though numerically still the majority came to seem less important as new directors emerged with rawer, more distinctive styles

In New York he joined forces with John Houseman to New York Federal Theater and then for the Mercury The atre, which he and Houseman founded in 1937. He also directed and acted in weekly broadcasts of adaptations of literary classics, notably Dickens and Shakespeare. These broadcasts displayed some of the features which were to distinguish Welles's films~a dependence upon voice-over narration, and complex narrative structures involving embedded narratives.

The great independent producers of the 1930s and 1940s, Samuel Goldwyn David 0. Selznick, gave way in the 1950s to less ambitious operations.

## THREE AUTEURS

The of They Live by Night is an interesting example of how the system began to be opened up in the post-war period. Its director Nicholas like Welles and Losey, had a background in New York's radical theatre and had worked with Houseman in both theatre and radio before and during the war Live by Night was produced by Houseman for RKO in 1948 But it was not properly released for over a year, and then more because of the critical interest it had generated both sides of the Atlantic than because the studio had any confidence in it.

But when, on the strength of his skills at mise-en-scène, he was offered the opportunity to direct biblical epic, of Kings at Peking (1962) his   distinctive talent was-perhaps   inevitably-diluted.

In Hollywood he at first found little outlet for either his political radicalism or his sense of stylistic refinement But he found niche at Universal, making low-budget films of various kinds. In the 1950s he came under the control of producer Ross Hunter;, who specialized in cranout sentimental melodramas. In these unfavourable conditions he learnt to exploit the basic implausibility of the genre with an irony that laid the films open to conflicting readings. His best films of the period, however; were those in which he did not have to use irony as subterfuge to undercut the pieties of the genre: The Tarthe Wind (1959). Significantly, both these films were produced not by Ross Hunter but by Albert Zugsmith, who had earlier overseen king

At first sight, the Westerns of Budd Boetticher look like the most classical products ofthestudioera, inexpensively made formula pictures recycling well-worn themes of solitude and revenge.

## The Modern Cinema 1960-1995

## Introduction

The changes that have taken place in world cinema since 1945 have been for the most part gradual. There is no single event comparable to the rapid transition to sound that took the world by storm around Nevertheless the years around 1960 can be seen as a watershed, with developments across the world concurring to make the modern cinema different in many respects from that of previous periods

ence in the Oberhausen Manifesto of 1962 and went on to decade. In Italy the change was less sudden but none the less significant, with the release of Federico Fellini's La dolce vita and Michelangelo Antonioni's Lavventura in 1960 signalling both the definitive demise of neo-realism and the arríval of a new art cinema

The crisis facing the studios did not mean the end of their power, since the companies were able to transform themselves and indeed to consolidate their grip on worldintegrated system; with the same company controlling all aspects ofa film's progress , from conception toproduction to distribution to exhibition, had definitely become obsolete. This was the case not only in the United States but also in other countries which had followed the American model and which were beginning to face similar problems of declining audiences and unstable markets

The most significant  change-though also the most gradual-was that produced by the breakdown of the Hollywood studio system and of its competitors and imitators elsewhere. By the early 1960s the Hollywood system was in severe disarray. Declining audiences and a series of costly left the major studios on the verge of bankruptcy Or open floundered , new companies such as American International Pictures stepped in, making low-budget movies for the new youth These movies tended to be formulaic almost by definition, but the formulas were flexible and new genres and subgenres came into such as the road movie, which were to prove influential not only on more mainstream American films but throughout the world. The mainstream itself was forced to innovate, drawing inspiration both from the down-market   competition and from the new cinemas emerging in Europe flops being'

In Europe was the sudden explosion on to the scene of the French New Chabrol, François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard , and Alain Resnais following each other in quick succession in 1958 and 1959. The New Wave had been briefly preceded in Britain by the 'Free Cinema movement, and was followed by the Young German Cinema' which announced its exist-

Eastern European cinema also experienced renaissance in the 1960s. It began slowly, as the 'Thaw' initiated after the death of Stalin in 1953 spread its effects throughguished with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968-~the very year in which the wave of student rebellion saw a brief politicization of the cinema in the west, particularly in France and Germany.

Changes in the 1960s were not confined to Europe. The Cuban Revolution in 1959 gave an impetus to the growth of new cinemas throughout Latin America, notably in Brazil. In Japan the studio system which had nurtured the work of the great masters such as Mizoguchi and Ozu was also in crisis, and in the changed situation allowed for the entry on to the Oshima, who was to play a role in Japanese cinema similar to that of Godard in France.

The new cinemas greatly extended the boundaries of film art. brought new audiences into the cinema, for whom films assumed an unprecedented cultural importance Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s the cinema spoke more directly to these mainly young audiences than did any of the more traditional art forms But outside Italy and France the new cinema was not a mass-market phenomenon. Because of the limits on the size of the audience, the new cinema had to be low-budget Or propped up by subsidy (sometimes both) in order to new was absorbed into the mainstream In the process , however, the mainstream was renovated, not only in Europe but in the United States where a new ciné-literate generation of film-makers emerged whose first industrial experience may have been in the 'grindhouse' of cheap exploitation pictures but whose cultural horizons were formed by watching a mixture of old American movies on TV and European films in art-houses and on the campus circuit. From Coppola to Spielberg to Scorsese to Woody Allen to Quentin Tarantino, most of the major American film-makers who have come to the fore since the 1970s great debt to European cinema. They '

But this European cinema is now in crisis in its turn\_

Meanwhile the American studios, after the convulsions Not only have held off the challenge ofindependent producers and distributors in the domestic market. have also acquired, or reacquired, the global dominance that came close to enjoying in the 1920s before thwarted by combination of factors between 1930 and 1970 In cinema terms, the 'new world order' following the collapse of Communism threatens to be not just the triumph of West over East Or North over South but they They being they

Another development whose origins go back way but which has assumed increasing importance in the decades since 1960 has been the growth of competing forms of mass media, and especially television The modern cinema exists in very different environment from that which prevailed in the silent and early sound future development are shaped by the way this environment has changed and continues to change The first challenge to cinema's monopoly (together with attendant possibilities of 'crossover came from radio\_ This was followed, and intensified, by television; which has in turn been followed by video. This part of the book therefore opens with a section 'Cinema in the Age of Television' , which starts by looking at the steady growth--at first unnoticed, then regarded with hostility; and now the period The impact of television and related media was felt first in the United States and it was there that strategies first began to be devised to cope with it. Television and the challenge it posed to cinema major factor in the way the film industry; and Hollywood in particular, reorganized itselfin the 1960s and 1970s. It also promoted technological change as the cinema came to affirm its difference from its smallscreen rival through CinemaScope and stereo sound while also borrowing it, notably in the adaptation oflightweight equipment for documentary and experimental film-making. long from

One of the many results of the weakening of the old Hollywood system was the collapse of the tight system of regulation and censorship--the famous Production Code As a further way of differentiating itself the wholesome family fare served up on television (and also as a way of up to competition from the less heavily censored imported from Europe and revised and liberalized its censorship categories . The cinema acquired a new freedom of expression-but also a new form of market oriented regulation as films became classified according to the amount of sex and violence regarded as necessary to from being facing being

The liberalization of censorship can also be seen as part and parcel of a wider process of social change that swept through western society generally in the 1960s\_ In the United States the single most important element in the process was the shift in the balance of majority and mincultures initiated by the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Appropriately, the section 'American Movies begins by examining the presence ofblack people in American cinema and the changes that have taken place since the days when white people first peered into a Kinetoscope to watch The Pickaninnies Doing Dance and similar titles. The growing presence of blacks (and other minorities) in the cinema has not, however, seriously challenged the mainstream, middle-American orientation of Hollywood cinema. From top to bottom, from multimillion-dollar blockbuster to and cheerful grindhouse quickie, the Hollywood movie remains a machine in which social conflict is managed-and massaged-for the comfort of the supposed majority audience. Racial, sexual, and generational conflicts are resolved in favour of an imaginary and idealized centre from which only modest deviations are permitted. It tends only to be movies which are prepared to addressed mainly to gays, or to blacks, Or to the youth market-that operate outside the broad framework of consensus values. A main thread of this section; the way the new Hollywood since the 1970s has absorbed and to a great extent neutralized the pressures on it from non-mainstream cinema on the one hand and from an increasingly fissiparous society on the other cheap split being

Both the most exciting developments in world cinema since 1960 have taken place outside the mainstream. The questioning political climate of the 1960s combined with the introduction of new lightweight technology to produce revolution in documentary; symbolized by the idea of cinéma-vérité. The film avant-garde; quiescent since the same climate, symbolized in the 'Underground'. The quasi-disappearance of animated films from mainstream exhibition was compensated by an extraordinary vitality among independent animators~whose work   remains the sound-track and the musical score in particular that carry the burden of innovation. Every variety of modern music, from serial minimalism to rock roll, can be encountered on the sound-track of films since 1960. In this respect at least, Hollywood films can be as artistically daring as the more openly modernist art films' emerging aries' surveys all these areas, concluding with look at the rise and fall of the (mainly European) art film as

is noteworthy for the affirmation, often against the odds, of a complex of world cinema cultures . From New Zealand to Senegal, from Taiwan to Quebec, national and regional cinemas often have an importance that cannot be measured in terms of pure boxoffice. In some parts of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, indigenous film production is as the subcontinent, it has long and distinguished history. throughout the world, and for similar reasons-notably since 1945-cinema has been a crucial element in national context of American neo-imperialism and Hollywood hegemony. Whether conservative Or radical, traditional or modernist, the world's regional cinemas often define themselves against the metropolis and the centres of political and cultural power. Even at their apparent blandest they affirm right to differencethe right of Czechs to be Czech and not just satellites of Soviet power; the right of the people of Quebec to be Québécois rather than Canadian or American, the right of Africans to see their own culture reflected in the face of westernization

The book ends with two very different essays. The first is about the new concepts of film that have arisen over the past thirty years and the effects these have had both on the way cinema is thought and talked about and also (to lesser but none the less significant extent) on the kind offilms that have been made, whether in the margins of film history has been the chief beneficiary of the revolution in thinking about the cinema that has taken place since the mid-1960s

and the shifting balance between Hollywood and other cinemas and between cinema and other audio-visual media. Contrary to the oftenexpressed opinion that the cinema is in a state of irreversible decline, it argues that the cinema is very much aliveboth in the form of new films being made and in that of a history which (thanks to audiences across the globe.

## CINEMA IN THE AGE OF TELEVISION

## Television and the\_Film\_ Industry

Cinema and television are generally thought ofas distinct; whether as industrial practices or as viewing experiences . In fact the two have been quite closely interwoven, ever since television first emerged as a possible rival to cinema on an industrial scale. This was particularly true in the interests began in the 1920s, extending to television with the start of commercial television broadcasting in 1939.In European countries, where broadcasting was in the hands ofstate monopolies , remained separate for longer, but sincethe 1950s there has been a growing convergenceatall levels.

## BEFORE TELEVISION

In the United States , broadcasting developed as a system of privately owned, commercial stations tied together by two great networks and ineffectively regulated by the federal government. Hollywood studios first proposed an alternative programming structure which would have sup ported broadcasting from boxoffice profits. Paramount and MGM attempted to initiate their own film-based radio networksin the 1920s,using film talentundercontract to provide entertainment with publicity value in pro moting films . However; a combination ofexhibitors' objec tions andinability to obtain the necessary connecting land lines from AT&T blocked these efforts, and the studios turned to station ownership and the provision of talent to the advertising agencies and sponsors who produced the lywood stars and properties figured large in radio's golden age. Paramount purchased 1928, which it was forced to surrender under financial pressure late

Foreshadowings of television's imminent arrival occurred in the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia as early as the mid-1930s . Though the war temporarilydivertedproductionandplanningawayfrom domestic television, in the USA both networks and studios prepared tohitthe ground running as wartime restrictions eased.

Though unfavourable FCCpolicy reviews and decisions restricted growth of these petitive uses of the medium, Hollywood repeated its performance with radio by moving decisively into other

Bythe mid-1950s, resolution ofthe Paramountanti-trust case had caused US studios tosell off their exhibition arms, effectively removing their most pressing and vocal opposition to television involvement While one of the major spunoffexhibition divisions, United Paramount Theatres , did merge with broadcaster (ABC), most activity took place on the studio side and production for the emerging of primetime filmed programming emanated from the newly converted major and minor studios. The divestiture agreement also accelerated the breakup of the classic Hollywood integrated studio, and, as independent producers formed companies around two Or three broadcast or film properties, the former majors assumed a vital role in distribution. Any space on the back lots not used directly for studio production was rented out to the many small 'indie prods (in Variety's classic prose)such as Frederick Ziv, 'Desilu' (Desi Arnazand the networks began scheduling regular showings of theatrical films This was made possible because residual payment problems with musicians' and actors' unions had been settled , and network   advertising revenues had climbed to a level that allowed sufficient compensation for the films.

The studios largely eliminated the production ofBfilms, reflecting changed exhibition conditions as well as the duction and exhibition-a thriving component of 1940s to an abrupt halt, as news and documentaries shifted to television and newsreel theatres closed their doors.

Complica matters both British exhibitors and producers, an ample supply of American film product remained available for sale to emerging commercial services, and was actively marketed across Europe by the MPEA, the export arm of the Motion Pictures Producers Association.

## THE NEW ENTERTAINMENT ORDER

In the USA the first significant crumbling of the threenetwork television system came in the late 1970s as cable rapidly across the country; spurred by the potential of satellite distribution and relaxed FCC regulations on cable programming, including release of feature films. From 1972 to 1982, the number of households subscribing to cable jumped from 6.5 million to 29 million. With the success of satellite distributed pay-TV services providing uninterrupted feature films to time, owned by Viacom-Hollywood perceived both a new threat and a newopportunity.Atype ofverticalintegration had begun to develop in the major cable television MSOs (multiple systems operators), with such companies as Time Inc\_ and Viacom investing in film production, obtaining on their wholly owned cable TV franchises nation-wide. To combat the domination of these two firms over cable, four studios (Columbia, Paramount, 2Oth Century-Fox, and Universal) proposed their ownjoint pay-TVservice in 1978,called Premiere. Once again, anti-trust regulations enforced by the Justice Department stopped this service before it had chance to enter the market, and studios were forced to tunities for film studios to from the distribution explosion of the 1980s soon developed; including direct investment in cable television channels and broadcasting stations , the emerging videocassette market, and tinued production of both network and syndicated prOgramming. spread profit

Of these, the most significant for the cinema may be videocassette distribution, the revenue from which grew to exceed box office income in the later halfof the 198Os.In the light of this revolution, a new pattern of release for theatrical films has developed, with theatrical exhibition

The situation is, if anything, more volatile in European markets, wherederegulation ofstatebroadcasting systems opean services has stimulated the film-production industry.

In addition to national services, the unification of the European economy has contributed to the sudden explosion in DBS services.

## DIFFUSION

Hollywood has frequently been characterized as a kind of aesthetic vacuum, producing films devoid of any true national character but, by virtue ofits huge home market, sucking in talent from around the world. Certainly common pattern has developedwhereby talented directors many different countries; once have achieved level of success , export their talents to Hollywood. British directors suchas Scott, Adrian Lyne, and Alan Parker work almost exclusively in the USA; Gérard Depardieu ductions asin French. However; European films are finding new ways to tap into that American market. US cable channels are looking to diversify into new products and video from they Ridley =

This began in the mid-1970s as the TV movie expanded critically acclaimed series like War and Remembrance and Lonesome Dove is mini-series like Hollywood Wives or The Thorn Birds are regularly produced and give big boost to Since the turnaround time from production to presentation is so short, made-for-TV films can deal with topical issues, as about the possibility of nuclear disaster. ratings.

At around the same time, the world of cable television in the United States was transformed by Time Inc.'s innovative Home Box Office (HBO). For monthly fee of about $10, cable television subscribers could see recent wood motion pictures-uncut, uninterrupted by commercials, not sanitized to please network censors. For Hollyand

the first time, Hollywood had found a way to make TV viewers pay for what watched in their living rooms. HBO drew back the older movie fan who did not want to go out to a cinema, but loved watching second-run films on television at home they

Once it became clear that this market existed other companies were eager to emulate HBO's success. In 1986 Ted Turner purchased an MGM, not for its current productions; but for access to and library. Turner's SuperStation and TNT (as well as American Movie Classics and Bravo) fill the cable day with the best and the worst of old Hollywood films, and movie fans have a rich repertory cinema at home\_ ailing

Originally priced at more than $1,500, the cost of the Beta machines and their newer rivals 1980s, and an enthusiastic American public (plus millions in other nations) snapped up so many machines that by 1989 two-thirds of households were equipped to tape off the air OI run pre-recorded tapes\_ To satisfy this new demand, the number of available cassettes ofnew and old achieved equal status to network and cable television

Valenti's major studio clients underestimated the demand for films in the home\_ came about when outside entrepreneurs throughout the United States began to multiple copies of pre-recorded movies and to rent them to the public. Soon stores on every street corner; and the Hollywood majors, seeing the huge profit potentialofthe medium, began to capitalize on this apparently insatiable demand\_ By 1986 'ancillary' video sales the 1990s the VCR was genera more than $10 billion in rentals and sales in studios found new market for their product; blockbusters were second lease of life when distributed on video, and certain films. like Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983), which were only modestly successful at the theatres, found their audience through home video rentals More people were watching more Hollywood films than ever before--at home public buy passed ting given

Despite the dramatic changes ushered in by the video revolution, and the fears of the studio bosses, audience attendance at movie theatres did not collapse. In fact, by the beginning of the 1990s an average of nearly 20 million fans each week visiting multiplex cinemas in the

United States. In 1990 there were more available movie screens in the United States than at any time since the late 1920s.

In the blockbuster seasons  (summer; spring holidays) Hollywood sponsored multiplexes so as to have room to release more potential blockbusters in more locations, simultaneously. Films like Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) thus opened on nearly 3,000 screens across the United States. This meant that, during the seasons of autumn and spring, screens were available for lower-budget films, with smaller potential audiences As consequence, black film-maker Spike Lee was able to distribute Do the Right (1989) through Hollywood companies to thousands of screens; David Lynch's cultish violent Blue found an audience  during   the autumn months; Platoon (1986), a serious look at the Vietnam War; reached the status of a hit; and Warner Bros was willing to release Blade Runner (1982) in a 'director's cut' version for two weeks in late September 1991, following it with a widespread rerelease in 1993.

## IN THE BOARDROOM

The Hollywood majors sought to take full advantage of all the new markets for their product, in the home and at in movie viewing, the major movie corporations lost none of their power. In the new climate, they not only survived prospered. A handful of companies, formed more than half a century previously, continued to monopolize the creation of movies, and their distribution throughout the world In the 1980s, the profits of these companies attracted   buyers from abroad, and new owners , but showed no signs of weakening. Indeed, if anything, mina all serious competition. they gained they they Iting

Warner Communication, formed start of the 1970s, grew to include divisions handling popular music, publishing and cable television, as well as the core Hollywood movie-making and movie distribution operations When   Warner with Time in 1989 created Time Warner, the largest media company in the world and the quintessential media conglomerate. Cable and television production vided consistent profits, and the Warner  Bros studio produced a number of the top grossing films of the early 1990s including Batman and Batman Returns, both ofwhich they

Many independent film-makers have established their own production companies as a legal means to make their pictures, such as Spike Lee's corporate umbrella 40 Acres and Mule or Ray Stark's Rastar. However, they are still almost wholly dependent on the distribution arms of the vertically integrated majors: in the 1990s-Paramount, Warner Bros , Matsushita's Universal Pictures , 2Oth

In 1985 2Oth Century-Fox was bought by the Australian (now naturalized American) media tycoon Rupert Murdoch From the base of his world-wide media conglomerate, News Incorporated, Murdoch transformed the ailing film studio into a media empire with formidable film and television operations\_

The $20 billion consolidation of Time and Warner in 1989 created renewed interest in the concentration of takeover of MCA (and its Universal Studios) a year later proved the 'prices that rich foreign corporations were willing to pay for place in Hollywood.

This, despite millions made from RoboCop (1987) and Dances with Wolves (1990), and despite the regular release of Woody Allen's films.

Paramount Pictures took a new direction in the early 1980s, when president Charles Bluhdorn died and time assistant Martin S. Davis took his and to sell off the non entertainment-related businesses. By 1989 what remained, now titled Paramount Communications , encompassed television and film properties including a share of the US cable network (in partnership with MCA/Universal) an active television production unit, Paramount also retained its movie studio on Melrose Avenue (the last lot actually situated in Hollywood) , from which it produced a regular supply of films, from the Star Trek series (1979 to 1994) to The Hunt for Red October (1990). longplace began

## ON THE SCREEN

Ironically. in this age of Hollywood hegemony, its films were increasingly treated as art. The influential New York Times reviewed movies with a seriousness once reserved for dance and theatre, and specialist magazines heralded a new age of American cinema

The 'new" Hollywood dates from the 1975 release of younger generation of Hollywood directors. Born in the

1940s, had grown up with cinema, and had a passion for the films of classical Hollywood, but also had studied and were influenced by the masters of foreign cinema. For example, both Spielberg (on Jaws) and Lucas (on Star Wars) consciously modelled the pace and look of their block busters on Kurosawa's classic The Seven Samurai\_ Francis Ford Coppola proved with The Godfather (1972) that remakHollywood genres from the with the influence of art cinema, could also mean millions and millions of dollars. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg followed Coppola's lead, making blockbusters, and in the process rectly anticipated return to classic principles. Indeed the very basis of the success of 'New' Hollywood was the most easily packaged, and sold on mass scale to audiences around the world. they ing past,

The return to genre production in Hollywood can partly be seen as response by producers to the increase in budget sizes, and the related risk involved with blockbuster production. Elements of a film that already been market tested, Or on which a film can be marketed, become crucial in this climate (this is also why certain stars commanded such enormous fees) Central to this trend was the sequel. By 1990 there had been five Rockys, four Supermans, five Halloweens, and eight Friday the 13ths an original (1978) plus sequel (1980). Successful films also generated whole genre cycles. The gangster film (from The Godfather) and the horror film (from The Exorcist, 1973) arose in every possible form: werewolves in Joe Dante's The Howling (1980) and John Landis's An American Werewolf in London (1981); vampires in John Badham's Dracula (1979) and Scott's The Hunger (1983); and zombies in George Romero's Dawn of the Dead (1979) and in John Carpenter's The Fog (1979) Hollywood sought a follow-up that matched the box office power of the original. have Tony

It made Universal a great deal of money and made Lucas contemporary Hollywood day

If George Lucas and (to a degree) Steven Spielberg are now best known for their successes as movie producers , there have been many contemporary directors who have stuck to directing. Probably the most famous auteur film-maker has been Woody first as star; then as director Audiences   loved his neurotic humour in Love and Death (1975), the Oscar-winning Annie Hall (1977), the black and white Manhattan (1979), and as the 'humanchameleon' in Zelig (1983). Allen has also made more self consciously serious films, such as Interiors (1978) and Stardust Memories (1980), loosely based on Ingmar man's Cries and Whispers (1972) and Federico Fellini's 8} (1963) respectively. public, Berg

George Lucas and Steven Spielberg teamed up to create the mythic adventures of forces from the past in the phenomenally successful Raiders of the Lost Ark series

## HOLLYWOOD ABROAD

The international market is central to the profits of the studios in New Hollywood\_ Blockbusters, such as Fatal Attraction (1987), Rain Man (1988), and Cocktail (1988), all grossed more money overseas than in the United States, and stars such as Arnold Schwarzenegger; Sylvester Stallone; and Eddie Murphy are able to command multimillion-dollar salaries, in part because oftheir international appeal. Hollywood moguls are concerned about the this has led in recent years , to joint deals between Hollywood and foreign companies to build theatres in Great Britain, Australia, Germany, Spain, and France, even in major cities across the former Soviet Union. In Britain alone Hollywood   companies (led by MCAs   Cineplex Odeon) helped sponsor the construction of more movie screens than had been seen in generation. This move back towards total vertical integration is seen as an ideal way for studios to protect their interests abroad and maximize their profits

## CINEMA AND TELEVISION

In January 1950 the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, an organization which had been founded in 1916 and which was dedicated and practice of motion picture engineering' , changed its name to the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. In doing so, the Society botl1 acknowledged and anticipated the changes that were (and would take) place in post-war entertainment technology. taking

In a sense, stereo magnetic sound, in which electronic More properly, television is a sound technology; evolving out of radio; electronic transmission; and other sound-related technologies. It is clear that the two technologies are closely interrelated. Itis no accidentthat film sound expert Ray Dolby, an American physics student at Cambridge who founded Dolby Laboratories in London in 1965, was , as an undergraduate at Stanford a central figure in the development of the Ampex   videotape recorder (1956). At Dolby Labs in London, Dolby developed crucial noise reduction system for sound recording (c.1966). Later, at Dolby Labs in San Francisco, he intro duced optical stereo sound-on-film system (Dolby SVA, 1975); a six-track, 70 mm. magnetic format; spectral recording system (Dolby SR, 1986), as well as nology.

Television would, of course, become an increasingly powerful presence in leisure-time activities As the (from 4 million in 1950 to 32 million in 1954 in the United States alone) more and more people traded their moviegoing habit in for home-viewing habit. However; 'tele vision means more than the familiar broadcasting of TV signals and receptionon home TVsets.

## SOUND

The attempts by 2Oth Century-Fox to innovate and diffuse stereo magnetic sound in the 1950s failed, largely because small and independent exhibitors refused to install the necessary equipment. However; large urban theatres continued to run CinemaScope films in four-track, magnetic Panavision 70, Ultra Panavision 70, and other wide film processes which featured six-track stereo magnetic sound The 70 mm blockbuster dominated the marketplace in the 1960s. It included films such as Ben-Hur (MGM Camera 65, 1959), Spartacus (Super Technirama 70, 1960), (Super Panavision 70 1961), Lawrence of Arabia (Super Panavision 70, 1962), Cleopatra (Todd-AO, 1963), The Sound of Music (Todd-AO, 1965), and 2001: A Space Odyssey (Super Panavision 7O/Super Cinerama, 1968) Story

The multi-track stereo sound in 70 mm. houses was dramatically better than that in the average movie theatre and better than that which most audiences could hear at most consumers , were monaural. Buthome sound systems gradually began to improve. In 1948 Columbia Records records. By the mid-1950s,a number of audiophiles owned

But home stereo did not begin to secure foothold in the market-place until 1957, when the American record industry began to release (two-track) stereo   records Within a few years, stereo recordings (of largely classical music) were produced for home listeners in the United States and Europe. By 1961 handful of American FM stations   began to broadcast radio programmes  in on the FM bandwidth was initially limited; the American Federal Communications Commission did not open up the FM spectrum until 1964 remained limited phenomena until the 1970s By 1969\_ to stereo; and improvements in home stereo systems had filtered down from the audiophile to the average consumer.

Dolby's involvement with motion picture sound began in 1971, when noise reduction system designed to reduce tape hiss was usedin the recording and rerecording ofStanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Between 1975, when Dolby's four-track optical stereo format was introduced, and 1988 over 11,000 theatres world-wide were equipped for Dolby Stereo. Dolby

But it was the success of Wars in 1977, which featured an elaborate and spectacular sound design, that made Dolby a household name. Dolby SVA (Stereo Variable Area) sound upgraded the low end of the exhibition 70 mm system that incorporated an extended bass response that transformed 70 mm. showings of Star Wars Star

In 1975 Dolby's stereo optical system was introduced Scope, four-track stereo accompanied 35 mm. film optically printed at the same time that the film itself was printed, avoiding the costly process of magnetic striping and of transferring the sound magnetic tracks Dolby's optical stereo alsoenjoyed the advantageof being compatible with non-stereo projection equipment, which could play the prints monaurally.

Original photography in 65/70 mm effectively ceased in 1970 with the release of Ryan's Daughter, which was filmed in Super Panavision 70 However, Soviet filmmakers continued to use 70 mm.

Unfortunately; blow-ups to 70 mm. fail to duplicate the aspect ratio ofthe original 35 mm. negative; cropping the sides of 2.35 1 anamorphic images down to 2.21 1.

The success of Star Wars in Dolby Stereo (in 35 mm. and in 70 mm) led hundreds of exhibitors to convert to Dolby. In 1977, there were only 100 Dolby-equipped theatres; year later, there were 450; by 1981, there were 2,000, and world-wide (with 10,000 in North America alone) When magnetic tape was challenged by compact discs digital recording in the mid-1980s, Dolby engineered a dramatic improvement in the circuit functions used in to increase signal purity and to reduce noise and distortion\_ using

Dolby dubbed the process spectral recording (Dolby SR) and successfully introduced it into the film industry in 1986, effectively forestalling for several years the seemingly inevitable shift to digital sound recording \_ 1990, over 43,000 recording studios and broadcast facilities around the world had installed the Dolby SR system\_ By

In 1991, Dolby solved that problem by introducing an optical digital sound system, Dolby SR D, which combined an analog optical track with digital sound-track. More recently; Universal released Jurassic Park (1993) in 35 mm in analog (optical) Dolby Stereo as in the studio's own new process, DTS (Digital Theatre Sound) Digital Stereo. All prints carried an stereo soundtrack as well as an optical time code which enabled the film to be up to a separate CD player with compact discs carrying digital stereo sound-track. If, for some reason, the separate six-track digital sound-track failed , the system would instantaneously switch to the analog four-track Dolby Stereo sound-track on the print. optical synced

Digital sound in motion pictures remains at the experimental stage. In the late-1980s Eastman Kodak, together with short-lived optical digitalsound system, called Cinema Digital Sound, that was unveiled with the release of Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Dick engineers to put six discrete channels of sound on 35 mm\_ print, potentially enabling exhibitors who lacked 70 mm. equipment to provide a six-track stereo sound that could be comparable to that in 70 mm houses Unfortunately; Cinema Digital Sound necessitated the costly establishment of two release print inventories-one for analog and another for digital. And if the digital equipment malfunctioned , exhibitors would be unable to play the film. Tracy optical

## ELECTRONICS AND SPECIAL EFFECTS

In the wake of Star Wars (1977), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979), and other high-tech. science-fiction films, the art of special effects entered the space age. Specialeffects   work generally requires the exact matching of two or more separate film strips. In the 1950s and 1960s, this was accomplished by relying on precision matte work. Matte work involves the successful combination of two or more images by means of a masking device, which eliminates part of one image and substitutes part of another. However, the matching of the various motions of objects and characters in these multiple strips of film required painstaking and timeconsuming labour. Even the most successful matte work often revealed matte lines, was difficult to light, and, as a result, seemed somewhat fake\_

More recently, computers have used to generate graphics or to provide the equivalent of matte shots without matte lines or other visible signs of artifice.

The development Definition Television has encouraged handful of film-makers to experiment with the format, using it and post-production then transferring it to 35 mm. film for theatrical exhibition.

## FORMATS

Satellite transmission, cable and video have demonstrably pictures with an increasing number of viewers seeing films in the home. In 1975 Home Box Office began trans-

mitting recent motion pictures and other entertainment programmes via satellite to cable subscribers introducing service that augmented the 'basic' service (which consisted of the rebroadcast of network and local stations to subscribers in regions with reception) that had been in existence for several decades.

In 1977 Ted Turner turned to satellite transmission for his 'superstation', TBS, which broadcast old movies, sportevents, and other programmes. Shortly thereafter, Showtime (1978) and The Movie Channel (1979) entered the home movie channel market-place, joining forces in 1983. Similar developments took place in the late 1980s in Britain and Europe where Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB and number of European competitors introduced satellite delivered channels running movies, music videos, sports, and other entertainment programming. ing

## PORTABILITY

During the post-war era professional motion picture production equipment underwent transformation. The 35 mm. cameras became lighter; more compact, and more portable. The lightweight Arriflex, which was developed in Germany in 1936, found its way into Hollywood production as early as 1945 (Dark Passage) , though it did not introduced an innovative reflex viewing system in which a mirrored shutter, which was set at forty-five-degree angle to the plane of the lens, reflected the image as seen through the lens to the viewfinder. Today, virtually all motion picture cameras employ an Arriflex-style, reflex viewing   system. Éclair's 35 mm. Cameflex camera in 1947, was used extensively by French flm-makers during the New Wave. perhaps most influentially by Jean-Luc Godard and Raoul Coutard on À bout de souffle (1959).

## THE ZOOM

A primitive zoom lens had been developed in England individual, 'special effects' shots in handful of films (for example, in Love Me Tonight (1932) the camera zooms in on sequence) The first modern zoom lens was perfected in 1946 by Dr Frank Back, who marketed it as the Zoomar lens. Unlike  traditional lenses which possess only one focal length, was varifocal lens, which meant that it had variety of different focal lengths ranging from wide angle to normal to telephoto. This notimpossible, for a fixed focal length lens.

## Sex and Sensation

In American movies before the 1960s, Hollywood's notori ous Production Code dictated that characters got shot without bleeding, argued without swearing, and had havoc with plot and motivation in which either elided or occluded sexuality as an This is not to say that sexual desire did not circulate in American films, but it was displaced: the objects of this desire tended to be exotic, often European, femmes fatales unattainable, glamorous, female ideals like Garbo and Dietrich whose bodies were always somehow distanced from the desires animated\_ they

In Europe, and particularly Scandinavia, on the other hand, sexual representations had   always been paratively less censored. French and Italian cinemas were more open to the representation of adulterous wise 'illicit' , liaisons which;if not explicitly shown, were

silent and sound films from Renoir's (1926) to Max Ophuls's grand French films of the 1950s,La Ronde goround' , 1950), Le Plaisir (Pleasure' , 1952), and Madame de (English title The Earrings of Madame de 1953). In Italy; where certain earthiness had always prevailed, telling example is Visnovel The Postman Always Rings Twice, which portrayed the physical and material hungers of provincial characters in a visceral way that the 1946 Amer contemporary reality called for by neo-realism meant that films as diverse as Rossellini's Il miracolo ( The miracle post-neorealist films such as De Sica's Two Women (1960) and Fellini's La dolce vita (1960) would explore sexual themes across a wide range of settings, from Anna nani's 'innocent' immaculate conception to Marcello Mastroianni's decline into decadent sexual play. Nana

Despite these national differences, around 1960 many cinemas experienced, in thevarious renaissances and New Waves , marked relaxation of whatever formal or informal censorships had previously been in place. Along with new styles and more independent modes of production, many national cinemas moved towards new level of a new sensationalism. In Europe this liberalization was less remarkable than in the USA. For example, Roger Vadim's And God Created Woman (Et Dieu créa la femme, 1956) caused a sensation with Brigitte on the French Riviera. Though not radically different youthful context, relatively large number of extended sex urgency and impact-an impact that was not lost on the New Wave to come. One of the most important aspects of this New Wave was the prevalence of love stories in which what took place in the bedroom was as important as what took place everywhere else.

In Hollywood, by contrast, the long history of a smooth functioning, self censoring Production Code had so effectively banished the direct representation of sexual motive narrative that, when such motives began to appear; did so with all the vehemence of the return of the repressed. Challenge to the code had begun Otto Preminger' 's The Moon Is Blue (1953), whose sexual language (even the tame words 'virgin and 'mistress plot turning on the homosexuality of a member of Congress, and later with Mike Nichols's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf (1966), with a non-stop marital fight whose coup de théâtre from they

Gerald Mast (1986) has argued that what was most distinctive about the post-Production Code New Hollywood was its particular use ofsex and violence to cast a 'cynical look back on the genre films of old Hollywood' .

on Hollywood in the 1960s the film that seems most pre scient is Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). It was derided in as was its British companion, Michael Powell's less influential but perhaps equally symptomatic Peeping Tom (1960) In both these films sex functioned as the dirty secret, finally let out ofthe closet. Indeed, it might be possible to argue that Hitchcock's commercial success at exploiting this 'secret' despite initial critical disfavour was a crucial commercial failure closed off similar avenue of rep resentation in Britain. Iftoday the excesses of Psycho seem tame, even predictable, it is because its mix of sex and violence became paradigmatic not only of a whole cycle of low-budget 'psycho-horror' but also of the high-budget (1980), and more recent blockbusters like Fatal Attraction (1987) and Basic Instinct (1992)

Psycho represents an important turning-point in American film history: the moment when the experience of going to a mainstream film began to be constituted as sexualized thrill; a sort of sadomasochistic roller-coaster

Only in retrospect can we put the generic label 'horror" on Psycho; the label is legitimate because the film makes us feel horror, but in its time what we felt was and fear which could not be reduced to or explained by genre formula.

Another measure of the vehemence with which sexuality emerged in American cinema as the secret that could finally be told was in the new prevalenceofmethod bodily eloquence rooted in sexuality; especially in conflicting masculine-feminine, masochistic-sadistic motivations Stars like Marlon Brando, James Dean, and Montgomery Clift set the stage for a whole new generation ofmale stars whose masculinity was, unlike a John Wayne OI a Cary Grant, both complicated and conflicted-Robert different story for actresses, whose bodies had always been more 'sexually saturated' and whose emotions had always been more visible\_ Increased sexual motivations seemed to have narrowing effect on the expressive range of women on the screen, supplanting the intelligence and toughness of Bette Davis with the all-round softness of Marilyn Monroe, Jane Fonda.

Sex and violence~once the two great off-scene forces of popular American cinema-thus began to become in the 1960s the very raison dêtre for whole new cinematic tradition.

challenged byboth the more inexpensive mediumofvideo and the increasing  perversion of the mainstream. In effect, the hallowed avant-garde belief that sex was the privileged means of cutting through artificial civilization to arrive at supposedly primitive (but just as often uncritically phallic and misogynistic) bedrock of human existence had become the newly discovered 'truth' of the mainstream . 'transgressive' sexual rep resentations were de rigueur. The avant-garde no longer held the franchise.

Thus, although the of external or internalized censorship meant different in different national contexts, there is no question that something that might be called both 'liberalization' and greater realism' of tend to cite social and technical advances as enabling this new 'realism' as if cinema simply extended its already significant powers of realism at a time of more liberal attitudes towards sex. This newly realistic attitude towards those aspects of life that were once censored is explained as coinciding with the advent of cinéma-vérité technologically deterministic explanation always reaches point at which the realism seems to go exceednewly drawn limits of taste or community stan-dards\_ The significant point is that the post-1960s game became that of perpetually challenging whatever limits were currently in effect.

In the USA an entire genre of hard-core pornography depends upon its ability to exceed the limits of mainstream standards of representation. Frequently cited as the place where sexual representations reveal the fundamental misogyny of all representation, it turns out to be one of the few places where sexual representation functions for purposes of pure arousal, and one of the few places in all cinema where women could be seen seeking sexual pleasure without being punished for it.

The similarities of all these works are striking than their differences. Whether art Or exploitation, whether mainstream or margin, there is a new prevalence of sexualized sensation across the board in world cinema To understand the proliferation of sex and sensationalism in post-196Os cinema, we need to cinema fully 'place

The ratings system, designed as labelling device, to contain sexual and sensational   representations to age appropriate spheres, became the inadvertent cause of the incitement of sexual representations. Directors   worked hard to the desirable 'R' rating but fall just short of being the pornographic 'X'. Adolescents aspired to see the category just beyond their reach. American cinema had embarked on quest to bring larger spectacles and more 'adult' sensations get

James   suggests that liberalization is an inadequate explanation for the greater sexual 'freedom' of American-or indeed any other-cinema A good case in point is what happened following the final demise of the Hollywood Production Code and its replacement in 1968 by the MPAA system. This system; designed tolabel works according to degrees of sexual representations, language; Or violence, had crucial marwere supposedly appropriate for all audiences, in effect 'G came to mean bland entertainment appropriate for children and other people not conversant with the facts of life. In contrast, the categories of (parental guidance 'PG-13' (inappropriate for children under 13) and 'R' (restricted-persons under 'accompanied by an adult) became an ascending order of often truly gratuitous sex, language; or violence in flms seeking more 'adult" level ratings.

With the ratings system, as with the American obscenity law, sex was officially acknowledged as the new motive force' of the film industry Just as increased efforts to define the hard core of sexual   representation by Supreme Court Justice William Brennan are widely viewed as having opened the door to the legalization ofhard-core pornography the new ratings system functioned to control sexuality increasingly necessary to the marof films. It is true that under the Production Code graphic instances of sex been kept screen, and that under the new system such representations forcefully came on screen.

## EARLY CINEMA

Images of black people featured prominently throughout the history of American cinema go back to the earliest days of the filmic process itself, when Thomas A. Edison utilized black subjects in a number of aninnies Doing a Dance (1894), Three Man Dance (c.1894), Negro made for the Edison Company and A West Indian Woman Bathing a Baby (c.1895). This pseudo-ethnographic imagery continued through the embryonic of cinema, as movie presentation evolved from the peep show format to the large screen, with such characteristic titles as Dancing Darkey (Edison, 1897), Dancing Darkies (American Mutoscope Company; 1897), West Indian Girls in (Edison, 1907). have They years Boy Step

The and Wedding of a Coon (1905) was promoted as 'a genuine Ethiopian comedy' though, typical minstrel farce which caricatured the courtship of a 'Negro' couple. Interrupted Crap Game this early of racial comedies crudely mixed racist strel characters abandoning a dice game in order to chase chicken! Wooing cycle

Although these early movies were technically crude and lacked the iconic power of later, more developed modes of cinematic representation, were none the less instrumental in setting the cultural tone of black racial representation in the newly emerging mass-entertainment medium of motion pictures. The racial (and racist) thrust of this cinematic was especially pronounced in comic motifs. which tended to stress grotesque stereotypes of blacks based on Southern plantation lore. The repertoire of black-related characters and situations was therefore extremely narrow and centred mainly on 'plantation' spectacles, such as watermeloneating contests and fish buckdancing and cake-walking, and so on. they fries,

Sigmund Lubin, of considerable note, also made a fairly successful career out of exploiting racial comic motifs , notably with his 'Rastus' comedy shorts-How Rastus Got his Pork Chop (1905), How Rastus Got his Turkey (1910), and (1910)-and his 'ethnic' satire Coon Town Suffragettes (1914), which ridiculed the contemporary movement withastory aboutagroup ofblackcharwomen whoorganize themselves in order to control their wayward hus-bands\_ popular

These early racial motifs were usually set in socially and racially segregated situations, in which the black-face characters played out variety of exaggerated comic set pieces for white audiences' amusement. There was no and white characters in the story situations; indeed\_ the emphasis was on self-contained 'ethnic' vignettes which were designed to work in their own right as visual novel-ties\_ Sometimes film was promoted with a lot of hype about it being ethnically authentic, as in the case of The and Wedding of aCoon mentioned above. Production companies employed this tactic presumably to distinguish their product from other similar minstrel farces which were made at the time and which were undoubtedly popular with fascinated white audiences. Wooing being

Another strand of film comedy which was popular

during this period centred on quasi-sexual encounters between black and white characters. Many of these pseudointerracial comedies relied on the black-face visual gag to achieve their effect, however; with the black-face characters appearing predictably as stooges to the films' white (usually male) protagonists. The Colored Stenographer (Edison; 1909) is typical of the genre~a mischievous white husband hides his blonde secretary from his wife by sub stituting a black charwoman in her place. The black-face gag was also element in the of nuptial comedies-such as The Masher (1907), The Dark Romance of Tobacco Can (1911) and Seven Chances (1925)in which hapless wooer; who has to marry quickly in order to claim his inheritance is seen nearly wedding black woman accidentally before comedy shorts were not concerned with the controversial theme ofmiscegenation as such, however, but were driven mainly by the exigencies of the blackface visual gag and the sexual misadventures of the films' white protagonists. key cycle being

The Fights of Nations (Biograph, 1907) was rather more pernicious inits intentions andis perhaps more indicative blacks. This pastiche of racial stereotypes depicts a series Mexicans, Irish, and blacks-fighting each other and generally playing out their respective stereotypical roles. However; the film's tableau ending includes a reconciliation of all the ethnic combatants except the blacks In other words, the emblematic blacks are categorically excluded OI disenfranchised in the film's utopian (and racist) vision of civil society and universal harmony.

It was not uncommon for silent films to disparage blacks in such extreme terms, though there was probably a stronger tendency toward paternalistic constructions of black servility and comic relief. Southern plantation mythology played key role in anchoring this racist imagery within a readily identifiable cultural framework. It constituted an established body of quintessentially white American cultural and literary motifs which could easily be recast in cinematic terms

The plantation genre was thus established very early on type was Harriet Beecher Stowe's classic anti-slavery novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (first published in 1852).

The plantation genre, along with its associated racial imagery, reached pinnacle during the silent film era with D. W. Griffith's cinematic masterpiece The Birth of a Nation (1915) This film has been rightly venerated its artistic achievements and, at the same time, justly condemned for its deeply racist content. It deals with the prickly subject of the American Civil War and the period of Reconstruction in the South~a national trauma which many Americans were still recovering when Griffith made the film. Griffith himself was a Southerner, raised on theconservative values and traditions of the Old South. But his epic portrayal of that parochial experience succeeded in blurring sectional interests and antipathies in the interest of broader ideological objectives. He achieved this by interweaving the lives of two families representing North and South respectively; whose contrasting lives are eventually reconciled in the common interest of white 'in defence of their Aryan birthright'. for from

Race feeling ran high wherever the film was shown, which resulted in rioting in several major cities across the United States.

## SOUND AND 19305 'OLD SOUTH REVIVALISM

The advent of sound in the late 1920s hastened the insti tutional development of (American) cinema. It also made an impact on racial representation, in so far as it enabled degree of refinement to enter into otherwise traditional forms. It was in the context of corporate battles within the motion picture industry that Warner Bros. one of the larger independent producing companies , gained the initiative with the first commercially successful massfollowed by The Singing Fool (1928). The commercial success ofboth these films was largely due to their star, however the famous for his so-called blackface 'Negro imitations

Jolson's artistic' use of blackface in these films is an interesting variation on a traditional theme While it is obviously based to some extent on racial caricature, it does not fall strictly into the same category of grotesque 'Negro imitations' as early cinema's use ofthe convention Jolson's blackface alter ego usually appears at a crucial moment in the film's plot development, but it functions more like a clown in the circus sense, than a caricatural by the desire to exploit for melodramatic purposes the emotive content or pathos which the minstrel image is

The strident paternalism which underpinned Hallelujah! had very little impact on subsequent images of blacks in (1936). This Civil War drama espoused the same romanticized notions of the ante bellum South, replete pro-South Civil War films made during the 1930s. typical

more critical image of the American South was pro vided in the series of 1930s social realist films-including I Am Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1933), (1936), Won't Forget (1937), The Black Legion (1937), and Legion of Terror on controversial contemporary themes, such as the region's notorious penal codes, mob violence, and lynchings. Audiences were evidently horrifed by this 'realistic' image of the region, with its emphasis on endemic social injustice and sense ofisolation However; the flms themselves failed to undermine completely the more popular image of the romanticized South which Hollywood continued to propagate Fury They

Theante bellum genre culminated in theepic blockbuster Gone with the Wind (1939), which was based on Margaret Mitchell's expansive novel (first published in 1936). The producers of the film were evidently conscious of the controversial tone of The Birth of a Nation and concluded

that adopting approach for Gone with the Wind might have an adverse effect on the film's box-office prospects. The flm thus kept clear of the genre's more excessive uses of racial caricature and concentrated instead on Rhett Butler. Indeed, Hattie McDaniel's exuberant performance as the bolshie 'Mammy'\_for which she won an Academy Award (the first black person to do so) as best supporting actress-provided superficially humanized' inflection ofblackservility which enabled the film's racial constructions to avoid controversy.

Gone with the Wind brought to a close Hollywood's infatuation with the ante bellum genre. Yet it still managed to inspire and perpetuate curious nostalgia for the ante ant part in uplifting a nation Depression and on the verge of entering another World War .

The years following the Second World War saw major changes in the representation of blacks in American films

new social conscience emerged in Hollywood began to consider the dynaniçs of black-white interracial now conscious effort to project 'positive' images of blacks, to stress humanistic (as opposed to caricatured) qualities, and to focus more sharply on the social and inter-personal dynamics of race relations in contemporary American society. Much of this imagery was constructed across as rather narrow and simplistic in approach. But at the time it represented a radical break with earlier forms of racial imagery Four tilms-all released in 1949\_marked the arrival of this new trend: Intruder in the Dust, Home of the Brave, Pinky; and Lost Boundaries

Intruder in the Dust, based on the William Faulkner novel\_ centred on proud and noble black man (Juano Hernandez) whose stoicism forces a Southern white community to confront its own bigotry. This image was new, particularlyin relation to representations ofthe American South, though it was integral to Faulkner's idealist notion of 'the Negro as [keeper] of white America's conscience Home of the Brave problematized race quite differently

The use of a 'pathologized' central black character who lacks a coherent sense of untypical of liberal film   representation and did not reappear in subsequent liberal-assimilationist films.

While the image of blacks as powerless victims of bigotry was   prominent in the two other transitional liberal conscience films ofthe period~Pinky and Lost Boundaries; both of which werc 'tragic mulatto' or 'passing for white' melodramas-this tendency gave way to more proactive characters designed to play a more consequential role in problem oriented black 'heroes= were stereotypical 'good guys on became less prominent by the late 1950s,as more rounded (ie. less emblematic) black characterization began to be developed.

Black-whiteinterracial confrontation was none the less recurring motif in social conscience films during this period. This motif usually involved pairing a black protagonist with an unsympathetic white antagonist-the conflict symbolized a kind of moral struggle which would eventually be resolved through mutual respect and underout début as an actor\_is a typical exampleofthis motif, where the Poitier 'hero not only emerges as the moral victor over white racist tormentor but also shows an enormous capacity forgiveness . 'good Way his for

An interesting variationon the racial intolerance theme was explored in Odds against Tomorrow (1959), where the interracial Belafonte and Robert Ryan characters was finally resolved through their mutual annihilation. What is particularly interesting about this construction is the way the film worked within the conventions racial tension as the primqry destructive force that ultimately wrecks group cohesion and prevents the success ofthe robbery This anti-racist narrative can also be read as metaphor for society at large in which racial intolerance using

Anumber of films working within popular genres, such as the Western, incorporated social conscience themes during this period as well.

Indeed, the appearance of black characters in mainstream genres and story situations not only conveyed more plausible image of plural society but it also naturalized' the presence of blacks in both everyday and extraordinary human circumstances. Examples of this new orientation included the James Edwards character in The Manchurian Candidate (1962) Woody Strode in The Pro and Jim Brown in numerous films made during this Dozen (1967), Condor (1970).

## 1960s CIVIL RIGHTS THEMES AND IMAGES

Ihe black civil rights movement of the 1960s marked critical turning-point for race relations in the United States . African-Americans their   position in society and began to articulate new selfimages based on stridently 'positive' notions of 'blackness' (e.g. Black is Beautiful, Black Power; and so on) These social, political, and cultural developments inevitably impacted on dominant media representation not so much in terms of radicalizing black imagery but more in terms of broadening the range of blackrelated themes and images which continued to be articulated within the framework of ethical liberalism

motifs which had pre dominated in the previous decade gave way to relatively more complex constructions during the 1960s Blacks were no longer portrayed simply as emblematic figures or as the embodiment of liberal-integrationist ideals; at own conscience. Black actors and actresses also began to appear in diversity of story situations and genres , including roles which were not Racial understatement shifted the emphasis from race as principal theme to the personal or human qualities of the black character(s) in the narratives. In other words, race was no longer automatically privileged in story situations involving black characters. they

The 1960s Hollywood social conscience genre reached pinnacle with Norman Jewison's In the Heat of the Night (1967), a classic race relations drama which. echoing the confrontational narrative in The Defiant Ones, pits a sophisticated black detective (Poitier)   against bigoted Southern white policeman (Rod Steiger) The film works within the traditional conventions of the crimeldetective thriller genre, but the expectations of the genresuch as the resolution of the murder mystery-are undermined by having a black detective as the central protagonist

tutional relations Michael Roemer's Nothing but a Man (1964) was one of the few films which focused on black male-female relationships. Robert Downey's Putney Swope (1969), a satire set in an advertising agency which has been taken over by blacks, articulated the white independent genre's cynicism most sharply.

Florida in 1927, Sidney Poitier rose to become one of the most famous black actors in the history of Hollywood cinema. He entered the profession soon after the Second World War, joining the renowned American   Negro the new generation black actors that included Harry Belafonte, Ossie Davis, and Ruby Dee. He appeared in a number of Negro stage productions and was an understudy in the Broadway and touring productions of Anna Lucasta (1946-49), before making his Hollywood screen début in Joseph L Mankiewicz's No Out (1950) Tbis powerful drama about racial bigotry of the cycle of post-war social conscience flms which centred on black-white interracial relations in contemporary American society . Poitier' striking performance as the young 'Negro' intern ín a white hospital, who becomes embroiled in a tense racial situation, not only won him critical acclaim but also established him as American cinema's first (and only) emblëmatic integrationist black screen hero.It set the tone for all his subsequent roles which, in one way or another, reiterated and consolidated the image ofthe noble black hero overcoming the machinations of racial intolerance: acting Woy

This theme was especially poignant in the classic in: terracial drama Thec Defiant Ones (Stanley Kramer, 1958), in which Poitier played tough-minded convict who manages to escape Southern penitentiary with a raging white bigot shackled to him. Characteristically, the into a grudging friendship, then finally mutual respect Curtis both received Academy Award nominations for their performances; and Poitier himself won the award for best actor at the 1958 Berlin from Tony

Poitier's 'Ebony saint' image was now frmly established and reached a pinnacle in the 1960s, notably Heat of the NIght (1967) in which he played the sophisticated caught up in the machinations of a hostile Southern Love; and Stanley Kramer's then controversial romantic socially sophisticated doctor who woos the daughter ofa white suburban couple.

## HOLLYWOOD 'BLAXPLOITATION FILMS OF THE 19705

The first half of the 1970s saw the proliferation of black were designed to appeal primarily to black audiences in were mainly preoccupied with projecting stridently black superheroes This marked major shift away from the social conscience imagery of the 1950s and 1960s. This shift in imagery coincided militancy and black pride which had come to the fore during this period; though there was also an undertone of cynicism, especially following the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1969, which had come to define this postcivil rights representation. But while blaxploitation effecthe less essentially concerned with commercially the new blackoriented market. Many people felt at the time that this was worth paying, given the chequered history of black representation in mainstream American cinema They exploiting price

Ossie Davis's Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), based on black crime writer Chester Himes's popular novel was the first in the blaxploitation Despite its rough edges and sometimes over-exaggerated caricatures , the film none the less evoked the whole tone of the genre to wonderful effect. Gordon Parks's Shaft (1971) articulated the even greater effect, however, with its typical Hollywood look and seductive evocation of the black urban milieu its attractive male lead, and Isaac Hayes' s Oscar-winning music score. The commercial success of this film was also helped by the way that it worked within the familiar private detective genre; this enabled the film to appeal to both black and white audiences. Shaft helped establish within mainstream commercial cinema the notion of the sophisticated black superhero. cycle.

However; Melvin Van Peebles's independently produced, iconoclastic film Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss (1971) is widely credited with having initiated the real breakthrough in blackoriented films and the establishment of the black hero within lacking the polish of   Hollywood blaxploitation pro ductions , Sweetback nevertheless had a political and cultural edge which identified it explicitly as a stridently was also huge commercial success, which led many critics to conclude Song sharp

The detectivelgangster film was undoubtedly the most popular of the blaxploitation genres. These films were set in the contemporary urban milieu, romanticized the iconography of the black ghetto-its subcultural styles in and glorificd the ghetto as a kind ofnoble jungle The films often contained a lot of sex and violence, and their heroes were invariably shown coming out on top in confrontations with the white establishment. With the possible exception of Across mythologizing blackthey

specific themes and images than with formally reworking the conventions of the detectivelcrime genre

Blaxploitation films were widely criticized by black rights organizations and professional bodies as having a made up the bulk of the audience for such films The NAACP and the Congress for Racial Equality (CORE), for example, formed an alliance in 1972 to attack the blaxploitation trend while local organizations across the country formed committees to 'vet' film scripts and to provide production companies with 'permission to film in black neighbourhoodsA number of blackowned pro duction companies were also established to try and meet growing demands for more responsible approach to blackoriented films

Similarly, blaxploitation Westerns set out to recast the genre in black terms, though the majority of films were driven primarily by popular entertainment concerns. One of the most interesting blackoriented Westerns during the period was undoubtedly Sidney Poitier's directorial début film Buck and the Preacher (1972) This film not only highlighted the historical presence of African-Americans in the expansion of the American frontier but it also adhered fairly closely to the conventions of the WesternJwagon-train genre. However, the series of blaxploitation Western action-adventures which featured exfootball star Fred Williamson-including The Nigger Charley (1972) The Soul of Nigger Charley (1973), and ences largely because of Williamson's cultivated machismo, which conformed perfectly to blaxploitation's notion of the black superhero\_

Certain films were celebrated on the other hand as meaningful OI positive   representations of black life\_ Among these were Gordon Parks's The Learning Tree (1969), based on his autobiographical novel about growing up in Kansas during the 1930s; Martin Ritt's Sounder (1972), another 1930s story about young boy's experiences in the South; Ossie Davis's Black Girl (1972); and John Korty's The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman (1974), an ambitious television film in which Cicely Tyson portrays old black woman recounting her life from slavery to the civil rights years. These films, it was argued, reinstated sense of humanity in the screen image of African-Amer-icans\_which many people felt had been badly damaged in the post-civil rights 1970s.

The demise of the blaxploitation cycle in 1975-6 saw a complete reversal of the Hollywood blackoriented trend. For the remainder of the decade. there was virtually total absence of prominent black characters OI images in popular mainstream films, exploitative Or otherwise Black characters still appeared fairly regularly in Hollywood of course, were now marginal seen they being

knocked into place by the decade's new white superheroes, such as Harry. There was also shift in industry thinking regarding the market, as Hollywood 'discovered' that black audiences constituted a significant proportion of the general moviegoing public. This made it no longer necessary or important to target black audiabandoned without it having an adverse effect on the industry's improved financial position. Dirty

## 'CROSSING OVER INTO THE 19805 AND 19905

By the early 1980s the emphasis had shifted again, but having black characters Or dramatic situations which would appeal to a wider (ie. predominantly white) mass audience, while retaining expressions of black identity winning role as the demanding drill sergeant in An Officer resentation quite aptly both in the way that it articulated the black antagonist figure as kind of deracialized bogeyman (for the predominantly white recruits at the military academy) and in terms of the racially understated tension between his character and the film's central white protagonist (Richard Gere). This confrontational interracial relationship was devoid of any ethical Or moral underpinning; it functioned instead as particularly intense form of myopic individualism

The incorporation of black themes and images into mainstream popular cinema during this period was also highlighted in the of big-budget productions made by white directors--which included notably Miloš (1984), Norman Jewison's A Soldier's (1984), Steven Spielberg' s The Color Purple (1985), and Clint Eastwood's had moved on, none of these films articulated the sense of an earlier generation of Hollywood liberals. Thus, in the black situations either stood on their own terms, cycle leading Story things

Three Hollywood black stars in particular epitomized the impulse towards crossing over during the period \_ Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy; and Whoopi Goldberg .

Thus, in a perverse sort of way, had come to symbolize complete racial integration in popular American cinema. they being they

Or backdrop to essentially white oriented story-lines. they

The most significant turning-point during the decade was undoubtedly African-American director Spike Lee's low-budget commercial hit She's Gotta Have It (1986) This film about a young black woman's sexuality and relations with men avoided the angst-ridden melodrama of The Color Purple and stressed instead a kind of humorous Brechtian exploration of sexual desire and intrigue. more importantly; Lee's film effectively set the tone for a new wave of African-American popular cinema which not only explored range of themes from within black perspective but did so within the terms of mainstream commercial cinema\_ But,

The Color Purple was a notable exception; not so much in terms of its ethical stance as in terms of its handling of the subject-matter: Based on black author Alice Walker's on the woman (Whoopi Goldberg) who has suffered mental and that Hollywood had focused on such a theme (black male female relationships) so sharply; it was obviously a far cry from the traditional 'mammy stereotype; but it also proved highly controversial, especially in the hands of Spielberg , who characteristically manipulated the emotive content of the drama to full effect.

This development is clearly seen in Lee's own sub sequent films which focus on colour caste and social class relations in the context of an all-black college (School Daze \_ 1988), interracial relations in mixed New York urban neighbourhood (Do the Right Thing, 1989),interracial sexual relations (Jungle Fever, 1991). black jazzlmusic culture (Mo' Better Blues, 1992) follwed by the expansive biopic of the late African-American   political leader Malcolm X Lee achieved the kind of market breakthrough which only fifteen years before him, with the cult hit Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss with number of those made by other African-American directors from the late 1980s onwards (such as Robert TownReginald and Warrington Hudlin) succeeded in appealing to wider audiences without necessarily adopting all the values of 'crossing over'\_ doing Song. along

By the 1990s, the preoccupation with African-American experience began to address the controversial but highly pertinent theme of inwards-directed urban violence and gun culture' .

attendance was broken; along with long-held stereotypes as parents stayed in to watch to be away from direct supervision, thronged to movie houses and drive-ins. Hollywood's short-term reaction to these crises was to come up with gimmicks like 3-D or innovations like Cinema and to switch over more extensively to colour films. Sheer spectacle was supposed to lure back the lost audiences, but the idea fundamentally misunderstood that times, and audiences , had changed. Scope,

The studios thought these were the films that would recapture the glory days of the 1930s, but the truly important and outstanding movies of the period tended to arise the involvement ofmajor talents with formerly lowesteem genre material. Robert Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly (1954), Anthony Mann's The Man from Laramie (1955) John Ford's The Searchers (1956), or Alexander Mackendrick's The Sweet Smell of Success (1959) were released without much fuss and but now stand as far more resonant say, best picture Oscar winners Around the World in 80 (1956) or Ben-Hur (1959). A symbiotic relationship existed between the majors and the independents\_ with any given success inspiring no-frills follow-ups, so that serious, adult pictures like Blackboard Jungle (1955), which expects its audience to side with Glenn Ford rather than Vic Morrow, would lead to the likes of High School Caesar (1960), in which teachers and parents are marginalized background figures and troubled kids carry the weight of the drama Even Rebel without a Cause (1955) was located in grownup genre of psychological problem picture, though Nicholas and James Dean skewed it away from mediating authority figures in order directly to address teenage audience.

The archetypal AIP title is the Cohen-produced Was a Teenage Werewolf (1957), which came out just as Hammer Films in Great Britain were another tackin reviving the Universal horror of the 1930s and 1940s.

While Hammer   rejected the grey science fiction pre dominant in American monster movies in favour of colourful supernatural themes, AIP stuck with radiationplagued mutant movies, reviving the werewolf, Frankenstein; and vampire subgenres with pseudo-scientific nonsense.

By this time, the matter of major studio vs. independent production had come to mean a lot less: Spike Lee's small, personal, and irreverent Do the Right Thing (1989), made for UIP; was officially major studio product, while James Cameron's machine-made box office blockbuster star vehicle Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) made for Carolco, was an independent.

The last gasp of old Hollywood was the misleading but monumental success of The Sound of Music (1965), which prompted the majors to sink enormous budgets into starstudded, stodgily expensive musicals which died at the box-office, just as audiences reared on AIP were flocking to Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider (1969), itself an offshoot of Corman's The The With determination to repeat the disasters of history, Hollywood reacted by taking the money were was on imitations of The Sound of Music and wasting it on imitations of Rider, resulting in such misconceived mini-genres as the campus protest Or interesting but commercially doomed ventures like Michelangelo Antonioni's Zabriskie Point (1969) and Hopper's The Last Movie (1972).

In the early 1970s, catalysed by wave of American introspection in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate\_ Robert Altman, Robert Aldrich, Sam Peckinpah, Bob Rafelson, Clint Eastwood, Don Siegel, Arthur Penn, Terrence Malick, and Francis   Coppola made outstanding films despite the directionless floundering of the film industry Often these talents were backed by major studios and rewarded by commercial success.

When the Corman-trained generation came to the fore, often returned to the material of AIP with a new, penetrating intelligence: Coppola and Lucas made American Graffiti (1973), which owes debt to AIP's beach party musicals.

Hollywood regained its financial footing in the mid1970s by abandoning the concerns that had made the best American movies important. Spielberg's Jaws (1975), the first of the Movie Brat mega-hits, is reduction of the liveliness of the best monster movies into an efficient thrill machine The films that have subsequently scaled the box office heights have been exploitation movies with multimillion budgets. While it is obvious that the Star Wars or Indiana Jones films are emptily expensive, if sometimes pleasing, retreads of old-fashioned kiddie genres, it is less remarked that Ridley Scott's Thelma & Louise (1991) is essentially better-packaged rerun of Michael Miller's Jackson County Jail (1975). In smoothing the technical rough that make most exploitation movies unacceptable to mainstream multiplex audience, blockbusters have attitudes that make them interesting to their by-nomeans unsophisticated audiences. This led to the retaking of the commercial high ground by the majors , and to a cinema characterized by the mechanical assemblies of Home Alone (1990) and Basic Instinct (1991) edges

this means a useful afterlife for some fine movies which rental market by conservative chains (along with the passage in the UK of the Video Recording Act) has ordered the interesting chaos of the early days of the industry and encouraged the production of genre films that are actually generic. Exploitation, especially as practised by companies like New Line, has become a matter of franchises with sequels hitting video racks as if films were McDonald's meals, each instalment in the Elm Street or Child's series required to deliver exactly the same qualities as the last.

The 1980s and 1990s successors to Scorsese, Romero, and Altman come from tradition that stands as much in opposition to grindhouse formulas as it is set the gloss of the majors, siding with oddballs like Larry Cohen or David Lynch rather than the pop promo or TV 'ad grads' who are assigned before signing up to do big star action movies for Joel Silver. Oddities like Abel Ferrara's King of New York (1989), John McNaughton's Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1989), and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir (1992) are influenced by the 1970s horror tradition but alienated from the 1980s and 1990s horror industry. As comfortably assessed as art films as exploitation, these are post-modern exploitation movies which deconstruct traditional plots Or themes while delivering the sort of state-of-the-nation addresses  last seen in the cinema. These are extreme movies and often find themselves at the centre of a censorship uproar which rarely troubles less daring luridness, but which at least serves to utmost violence, sleaze, Or emotional agony.

## Dreams and Nightmares in the Hollywood Blockbuster

The blockbuster hit of 1991 was James Cameron's Terminator 2, which offered audiences some of the most spectacular special effects since the Star Wars era of the late 1970s and early 1980s Formally, Terminator 2 also resembled the blockbusters of that period in its extremely pace and its logically, like those earlier movies its motivating anxieties were rooted firmly in the Cold War. Although the film passing reference to the that the Russians concerned the chilliest fear of years , the destruction of humanity in a nuclear holocaust (spectacularly simulated in a dream sequence within the film) Finally, Terminator 2 recalled the Star Wars era blockbusters in its faith in the capacity of human beings to control their destinies on grand scale, since its team of heroes succeed in altering future history and preventing nuclear obliteration fast fact story

However; considered in relation to its blockbuster predecessors , Terminator 2 also showed much had changed. Like many other popular movies of the late 1980s whose survival was in question was suggested by the fact Schwarzenegger and Robert Patrick) both played killing machines that only superficially resemble human beings . The sequel added a twist to the original film (1984's The Terminator) by having Schwarzenegger' s Terminator work guys this time around, and the film played for both comic and sentimental effect the subplot in which the white male killing machine is re educated to be responsible, protective caretaker. But just when the Terminator has been reformed enough to destroyed if the world is to be saved The film thus sug gested that his identity was too closely tied to his origins as killer; something which even sensitivity training could not overcome time, Terminator 2 was a meditation on the problem of the white man. how good

The period of which Terminator 2 is representative is often called the era of the modern blockbuster; and stretches from George Lucas's 1977 state of-the-art space opera Star Wars up to and beyond Steven Spielberg's 1993 have observed\_ genres were still made coexisted with an explosion of emerging new categories which made use of being they

The most highly successful and broadly popular movies of this era are best understood as ideological fantasies about the relationship of the American nation to the realities and implications of its own recent history; which included the assassinations and social upheaval of the 1960s and the political scandal and corruption of Watergate in the early 1970s. But even more important for the purposes of this discussion, that history included on the one hand America's traumatic experience of defeat in Vietnam, and on the other the emergence of newly miliand sexual) for greater representation and equality at all levels of American society and culture:

these films addressed the problem of America's performance anxieties in the wake of more than decade of what was now perceived as domestic and international failure and humiliation What they had in common was commitment to reviving American self-confidence through reimagining the strong white male hero.

The defining features of the triumphal period were summed up in a remarkably literal form in 1985's Back to the Future. In the original film and its sequels, a direct connection was established between the 1950s and the 1980s; dealt with the trauma of the intervening did not exist, effectively eliminan them altogether. Teenager Marty McFly is accidentally sent back to 1955 when his friend the inventor of a time machine, is attacked in shopping mall parking lot by the Libyan terrorists who provided him with plutonium (the film thus connected itself to Reagan-era anxieties about international politics and US imperialism). Once in the past must see to itthat his parents meet and fall in love as were meant to, or he will cease to existMarty teaches his shy and nerdy father how to stand up to a bully and win the favour ofMarty's mother; thus assuring his own future birth.

In all these movies, we were meant to understand that the success of the white male hero lies in his capacity to have faith in his own abilities In a scene in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), old and tiny Jedi Master Yoda used the Force to raise Luke Skywalker's fighter from the swamp. don't believe it; Luke says, having been unable to accomplish this himself.

The special effects-oriented blockbusters and the Reagan presidency converged in their exhortations to the American people to share in this triumphal attitude, which also characterized films of the such as Rocky (1976), Superman (1978), Fame (1980), Risky Business (1983) and The Karate Kid (1984), as well as the blockbuster hits already mentioned. being period

## MULTI-CULTURALISM

By the middle of the 1980s, however; the triumphal periods of both Hollywood blockbusters and the Reagan presidency were coming to an end A variety of factors were forcing a redefinition of 'American' the beginning of the end of the Cold War and the increasingly apparent   damage caused by the administration 's neglect of domestic problems, particularly the desperate situation of urban African-Americans. The celebratory can-do mood of the country had begun to break down. The Reagan era unravelled in the Iran-Contra and Oliver North scandals, and the triumphal attitude of Hollywood's big action films was   replaced by grim, violent, and survivalist sensibility-as though the American experience in Vietnam was now being repls in internal and domestic terms. ing layed

This shift can be seen in biggest-grossing films of 1986. Top Gun was the apotheosis of the triumphal sense of renewed American confidence and power; in which present-day American military life was depicted with all the action and excitement of a Star Wars instalment. Tom Cruise's was comSolo (i.e. Oedipal conflict and roguish masculine posturing); the breathspecial effects sequences were between high-tech. fighter aircraft rather than spaceships War anxieties were explicit in the Russians jets which anxiety was implicitly invoked and overcome; as the film's Top taking

James Cameron's Aliens initially gave us a version of Top Gun's military bravado and can-do faith, in its team of 'Colonial Marines Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) to cleanse a human colony ofthe murderous alien killed except for one. a handsome white male. In a more typical action film (such as 1987's Predator, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger) , this character would go on to be the removed from the story before the concluding and most alien queen is won by a woman (Lt. Ripley) with the help of a girl child and male android-in other words, a team The movie celebrates the military but also shows it to be ineffective, and while the pro the film is not at all triumphal. The heroes survive rather than succeed , since all but one of the marines and all but one of the colonists (the little girl) are dead, and the survivors are left drifting in space, uncertain of rescue.

However, even if Hollywood was making more movies with black performers, they were still made almost exclusively by white men. Steven Spielberg's 1985 film The Color Purple, a white man's adaptation of a black woman's being

Aliens rendered the surviving white man unconscious woman. It was an early instance of trend in American popular culture that would become stronger: the commitment to multicultural consciousness , what both proponents and critics soon came to refer to as 'political correctness Commentators on the late 1980s have discussed multias the politics of identity) as the mainstreaming of a new sense of racial and ethnic pride, which arose as a compensatory response to the inability of minorities\_ especially AfricanAmericans, to achieve the social and economic equality that the integrationist civil rights movement had promised. What has been specific to the multi-cultural agenda is its emphasis on the politics of cultural representations , such as school textbooks or Hollywood movies. In Hollywood, a multicultural sensibility first manifested itself in an increasing number of movies designed to appeal to both white and minority (especially black) audiences, including, for example, flms starring Eddie Murphy and such as the very popular Lethal Weapon series.

novel about a black woman's life and experiences, became the focus of an intense debate about the politics of Hollywood's   representation of non-white peoples and cultures. Hollywood's solution to this controversy was to give small but growing number of independent minority film-makers the opportunity to make movies for mass audiences; for example Spike Lee, who became the most famous, important, and influential black director in Hollywood history: The critical and popular success of Do the Right Thing, Lee's 1989 study of explosive racial tensions in a small inner-city neighbourhood, gave rise in the early a series of movies made by black directors with largely black casts. These were most often stories about the violence afflicting urban black families and communities , and included N the Hood, Straight out of Brooklyn;, New Jack City; and Menace I Society. Initially restricted to movies by, for; and about African-Americans, Hollywood's multiculturalism showed signs of opening up big-budget film version of Tan's novel The Joy Luck Club (1993) was directed by Wayne Wang, who, like Spike Lee began his career making low-budget, independent films Boyz Amy

At the level of   production, there were advances especially for women directors, whose small but growing number included Barbra Streisand Martha Coolidge, Susan Seidelman, Kathryn Bigelow; and Lili Fini Zanuck Perhaps the most notable success story was Penny Marshall , former TV sitcom actress who went on to direct several critically well received and financially successful League of their Own (1992).

Women also benefited from the multi-cultural climate in Hollywood There were at the level resentation, beginning with the middleclass empowerment fantasy Nine to Five (1980), all the way up to the outlaw tragicomedy of 1991's Thelma & Louise\_ As a modest concession to protests against the   stereotypical roles assigned to women, of   Hollywood movies included a strong female character in what traditionally Lethal Weapon 3 (1992) added tough female martial-arts expert to the series buddie-team formula. more complicated response to feminism was seen in genre of what might be called 'women-withguns" the early 1990s films Terminator 2, Blue Steel , and The Silence women in kind of masculine were meditations on the unstable nature of gender roles and in American culture during this period.

The rise of a multi-cultural sensibility promised to give Hollywood began to produce more movies which offered the view from the margins of the dominant culture, most films continued (of course) to express the dominant culwas increasingly nervous ition of the white male in both American and global society. For example; in Back to the Future Part II (1989), Marty McFly's entrepreneurial spirit; which allowed him in the first film to rewrite history and improve the present, this time ends up changing things for the worse complicated series of plot twists, Marty's plan to get rich with book of sports scores from the future (suggesting Wall Street insider-trading scams) results in a version of 1985 in which his middleclass white family's suburban neighbourhood becomes ghetto hell of drive-by shoot: and bombedout cars. Marty's house is occupied by a black family; and Marty is mistaken for a rapist when he enters through his bedroom window and finds black inal returns in the sequel. The 'alternative' 1985 of Back to both the Reagan administration and blockbuster fantasies had tried so hard to forget. The film thus represented two different experiences of life in the 1980s not as the differing points of view of whites and non-whites; but as two contradictory and incompatible alternatives.

The dominant culture's fears about the politics ofident ity were also visible in Tim Burton's hugely successful Multi-culturalism took the allegorical form here of strug; gles between the vigilante-hero Batman, who is really rich each of whom has a distinctive 'marginal" identity; in the sense that exist outside of Gotham City's 'normal' society (significantly, some critics attacked the portrayal of the Penguin in Batman Returns as anti-Semitic) Their freakish identities are clearly figures for the underclass of urban minorities: are associated with crime, they are organized like gangs; and seek political power (as in the Penguin's effort to become mayor) The films offered straightforwardly fascistic solution to the social decay and disruption which attributed to people with deviant or marginal identities. But the films also showed a deep ambivalence about the embodiment ofthat solution, namely Batman himself. As the Penguin tells Batman in Batman Returns; 'You're just jealous because Im a real they they they they

As the Hollywood's blockbusters, which offered fantasies of white male triumph and transcendence in the late 1970s and early 1980s, had become more and more selfconscious that the white male identity was now unavoidably problem. This develop to what at first may seem to be a very different Hollywood genre of the period: star-performance vehicles\_ These showcased amazing performances of the sort associated with Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Dustin Hoffman, who are famous roles in which the impressiveness of the is function of how SuCcessfully the actor transforms his own persona in the performance It is performing the identities of almost anybody but the average white male, whose normative status marked him as in some sense having no particular identity. Such films represented a response to a question posed by the rise of multicultural power: does the white man get an The star-performance movies provided an answer in the white actor's simulation of non-normative identities, as in De into white working-class boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull (1980), Hoffman's simulation of a woman in Tootsie (1982), and Tom Cruise' s histrionic portrayal of Ron Kovic, a paraplegic Vietnam War veteran and politicalactivist; in Oliver Stone's Born on the Fourth of July (1989). acting for acting how

As the last example suggests, films which showcase technique and performance developed in the late 1980s into a genre which we might call 'disability films' in which the actor portrays white men who are victims of disabilities of one sort In Rain Man (1988), Dustin Hoffman played an autistic man; Pacino was blind in Scent of a Woman (1992); De Niro played a man who is temporarily revived from the coma-like state he had been in for years in Awakenings   (1989); and Harrison Ford became a kinder, gentler white man after taking a bullet (1991).

## THE WHITE MAN AS VICTIM

By the end of the 1980s, a number of critics were arguing that American culture in general had become characterized by fetishization of the victim (for example; in books like Robert Hughes 's Culture of Complaint and Charles J.Sykes's A Nation of Victims). Since white males could not gender (the categories privileged by the multi-cultural sensibility)  disability films offered one way in which white males could be imagined as a victimized group. The appropriation of others identities shown in the acting performance-oriented movies were relatively benign versions of a group of films which might collectively be called 'white male paranoia fantasies' . In addition to the two Batman films and Back to the Future Part II, discussed above, examples include the series of back-to-Vietnam movies from the mid-1980s Uncommon Valor, as well as films as RoboCop Down (1993), and Jurassic Park (1993). Whereas the disability film showed white men performing the identities of individuals struggling against   real affliction and victimization, these other movies--which were   tremendously   popular and cessful-sought in various ways to present the normative white male as himself a victim. Like the blockbusters of the triumphal period, these films featured white male hero who overcomes terrible villains and circumstances. But unlike earlier heroes, the protagonist of the white male paranoia fantasy must spend most of the movie enduring horrible physical and psychological punishment. Even in movies like RoboCop and its sequels, or Universal Soldier (1992) or the two Terminator films, in which the bodies of the male action heroes are fused with hard metal machinheroes do not protect them brutalization s0 Falling from

The blockbuster hit Die Hard, starring Bruce Willis as ways in which white men understood both themselves and the American nation as victims of various historical developments The film takes place almost entirely within the symbolically laden space of a corporate office building employs McClane's estranged wife. In case we do not get the point, in one of the movie's opening scenes the wife's Yale educated Japanese boss responds to McClane's grudgadmiration of the new building by joking, Pearl Anxieties about global competition and multi-culturalism are also seen in the Euro dominated but multinational and multiracial team of élite criminals who, claiming to be terrorists, seize the building and hold its employees hostage (including McClane's wife) while attempt to access the building's high-tech. vault. In addition to foreign competition; McClane is also afflicted by federal agents who refuse to listen to or support him in his solitary nuisance and obstacle to their own incompetent but by-thebook efforts ing they

However; Die Hard also suggested that the real problem for the white male hero in this movie was his relationship with his wife. Offered promotion that required her to move to Los Angeles, she chose separation from McClane over film between anxiety about American performance in the global economy and anxiety about masculine performance in the domestic economy: international competition has taken McClane's wife and family from him. His victimization by these forces is made most clear in a scene in which he floor covered with broken glass in order to save himself and thus survive to rescue his wife; we must then watch as he digs the pieces out of the soles of his feet. The threat posed to McClane's masculinity by his wife's career targets feminism as one of the forces victimizing the American white male tasies were in this way related to another important group the same period; 'backlash' movies in which were, in various ways, punished and put in their proper (subordinate) place. The most notorious of these was Fatal Attraction (1987), but the group also includes such diverse films as Baby Boom (1987), Misery (1990), and Pretty Woman (1990). from

The white male paranoia movies expressed the white male's sense of resentment and anger in reaction to perceived loss of privilege; told us that the normative they

society told him he was the oppressor. But as the global and economic dimensions of Dje Hard indicate, they also had a larger political agenda. brought together into single basic narrative whole range of anxieties about the erosion of American power and privilege in the face of increasingly successful competition from non-white peoples, coupled with simultaneous decline in ican culturalism and feminism, these films presented heroes who now stood for all white men in relation to women and other minority groups, but also continued to represent a fantasy 'America' , threatened by Third World and other non-white nations which could both claim the moral high ground and in some cases outperform the United States They

In Lucas and Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), the opening chase scene leaves Indy and his companions inthe forests ofIndia, wherehe becomes entangled in local power struggle: the evil Thuggees of the cult ofKali (associated with the local ruling class) have village with all its children, destroying its livelihood. The American white male comes to the rescue of the unfortunate Third World peasants, but only because Indy sees the possibility for deep along

Retrospectively; it would be difficult to underestimate how important the American experience in Vietnam was for virtually all of Hollywood's most successful movies as Peter Biskind has observed , 'couldn't help evoking Vietnam with its conflict between the weak rebels and the powerful Empire' . Thus Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Alliance stood in for the Vietcong, especially in the climactic battle on the moon of Endor in Return of the Jedi (1983), in which the clearly nonwhite and underdeveloped Ewoks use guerrilla warfare tactics, in a jungle-like forest setting, and prevail against the technologically superior forces of the Empire. Even if the allegory was not that specific, the Star Wars movies portrayed their white male heroes as the sympathetic underdogs fighting on the side of the Empire's victims\_ The Empire is an entirely white male organization, literalized in the all-white body armour of the faceless Imperial Stormtroopers. Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, in contrast, are allied with variety of minorities' (Chewbacca; R2-D2 and C-3PO, and the trilogy's only featured black character; Lando Calrissian) In other words, Americans were recast as members of Third World resistance movements, freedom fighters struggling totalitarian imperialists with more advanced technology and weapons (which made the Empire a condensation of both the United States and the Soviet Union). The Star Wars trilogy can therefore be seen as a fantasy in which America got to win the Vietnam War after all, by with the Vietcong. against siding

'fortune and glory' in the sacred stone, which he believes to be priceless archaeological treasure. Indy's double motive for helping the villagers recalls America's role in Vietnam, behind a rhetoric of heroic altruism. The film's narrative is consistent with the operations of wartime propaganda, since the natives are divided into either helpless pacifists Or satanic murderers . Once inside enemy territory, Indy is captured by the Thuggees, whereupon he is drugged, enslaved, tortured, and made to participate in rituals of human sacrificestoppingjustshortofsending his female companion Willie to her death\_ The cruel and excessive abuse Indy suffers at the hands of the Thuggees works to legitimize his intervention in the local conflict as well as the destruction of an entire ancient culture

sought to position Rambo as both a white male hero and victimized 'minority' . In the original First Blood (1982), Rambo was established as avictim both ofthe Vietnamese\_ who tortured him while he was their prisoner; and also no respect for and abuse veterans like himself. In Rambo (1985), the blockbuster sequel, Rambo gets to fight the war all over (but this time we win) when he is sent back to Vietnam to search for evidence of surviving American prisoners of war, whom he successfully rescues. As in the Star Wars movies , Rambo wished to identify the white male Amerthe imperialist forces occupying Vietnam This positions Rambo; who was once a part of American imperialistoccupation of Vietnam, as Second, like the Ewoks of Return of the Jedi, Rambo fights with guerrilla warfare techniques and primitive weapons better-equipped adversaries.

As fantasy response to America's defeat in Vietnam Rambo showed how, at least as Hollywood made use of it, Vietnam was something like the perfect basic narrative for articulating theanxieties ofthe dominant (whitemale) group about competition non-white to be collapsed together. With their depictions of white men as victims of forces both internal and external to the American nation, these films expressed frustration and fear at the erosion of the dominant group's privilege with desire to somehow 'make things right' again (for example, by going back to Vietnam and 'winning') Once the white man is established as a victim, he is able to lay claim to the moral entitlement that goes with victim status. In other words, the white male paranoia fantasy, which emphasizes both the suffering and the retribution of the hero, allows the white man to engage in the same violently aggressive behaviour that earned him his reputation as the world's chief oppressor; while freeing him from guilt by recoding that behaviour as justifiable acts of vengeance. from deep along along

## THE END OF THE ROAD?

However, in two movies released in 1993, Falling Down and Jurassic Park, the fantasy seemed to be reaching dead end. Falling Down tells the story of Bill Foster, referred to throughout the film as D-Fens' a name taken from the custom licence plates on the car he abandons in the middle of a Los Angeles motorway traffic jam in the film's

Michael Douglas as 'DFens' 'just trying to get home' in Down (1993) Falling

But Falling Down was ambivalent at best about seeing the white man as a victim; the film represents something like a confession ofthe pathetic reality for which Batman's vigilante hero was solution. By having DFens wander through multi-cultural urban landscape filled with victimized identities, and cally by linking him in several ways to a similarly dressed black man protesting a bank's refusal to lend him money, victimized identity among others. The white man is because he is understood as victim, not because he represents the American success story, the privilege and security that others wish to achieve. Falling Down kind of critical mentary on the white male paranoia of which it was also an example. Movies like Die Hard or Rambo were fantasies ways: the white male hero retained specifi-

opening scene The rest of the film is a series of encounters between an the multi-cultural realities and identities of Los Angeles tasies, DFens is multiply victimized by the usual combination of social forces: the global political economy (he has been laid off from his job in the defence industry divorced him because of  his violent temper, and has secured restraining order to prevent him from seeing their daughter); and multi-culturalism (Chicano gang members hassle him for infringing on their turf\_he does not recognize the cultural significance of their graffiti tags)

victim's position Whereas the white man was triumphant Or, alternatively, he is on the verge of retirement, as in the case of the detective Prendergast, who shoots D-Fens at the end and functions throughout as his sympathetic double (he is the only one who understands him)

The paranoia reached another dead end in Jurassic Park, Spielberg's special effects extravaganza about genetically engineered dinosaurs , which surpassed the earnings of EI to become the biggest-grossing movie of all time Anxieties about global multiculturalism (as opposed to Falling Down's domestic focus) were reflected in the combination of the film's setting on an island off Costa Rica, and the fact that the island's 'primitive' dinosaur population is divided up in exactly the same way as were the natives in Temple of Doom: are either peaceful and friendly (the plant eating 'vegi-saurs') or utterly murderous and terto straightforward allegorical confession of white fears about the advanced computer-driven   restraining systems break down, the exclusively female dinosaur 'natives' are set loose, and the white man finds himself at distinct disadvantage. Unlike so many earlier special effects-oriented blockbusters, there is no triumph at the end. In the film's climactic scene, just when the characters are cornered by the viciously intelligent raptors and apparently doomed, the TRex shows up and attacks the raptors. The white people escape death not through their own actions but because the predatory dinosaur identities are fighting among themselves . Jurassic Park , like Falling Down, worried world\_ they

Of course, outside the world of Hollywood fantasies the American white male was not an endangered species; only an identity in need of reconsideration in light of specific suggested, the problem for American society was to reimdiverse and violent world which was constantly trying to escape his control. Hence the re-emergence of the Western as a popular Hollywood genre at the same time that the white male paranoia fantasy seemed to be reaching its peak and sliding toward its logical dead end Back to the Future Part III, released in 1990, sent Marty McFly on yet another rescue mission, this time the way back to the overtly mythical American frontier of 1885, where Doc Brown has been stranded due to accident involving the time The first film of the Back to the Future all trilogy

offered fantasy of the white male's triumph over historical conditions, and the second was a paranoid nightmare of the multiplication of identities and histories associated with conclusion suggested that the answer to the confusion and disruption caused by this multiplicity is to be found in return to America's basic fantasy narrative about its own origins, namely the Western through this particular generic landscape allowed him finally to back the new and improved 1985 that he had come home to at the end of the first film and had lost in the course of the second. The Western's mythic power restores the white man's control over history bring

But while Back to the Future Part III used the Western in Reaganesque manner, as a fantasythat enabled the white once again, the actual Westerns that Hollywood began to turn out in steadily increasing numbers going into the 1990s were, as group, much more confused and ambivalent about the genre's meaning and utility as a national myth. The new Westerns seemed to beof two basic types. On the one hand there were multi cultural Westerns, which sought to represent the actual cultural (racial and ethnic) diversity of the American West erased from view; particularly the culture and perspective of the Indians. Examples include Dances with Wolves (1990), The Last of the Mohicans (1992), Geronimo (1993), Mario Van Peebles's film about a band of black cowboys, Posse (1993), and perhaps the inevitable 'women-with-guns' variation on the genre, Bad Girls (1994). On the other hand there was a series of Westerns that considered the white man's historical double role as both killer and protector, such as Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven (1992), and two adaptations of the often-told story of Wyatt Wyatt revisionist Westerns understood the white male as a problem even if they still proposed him as an answer. The films made use of the genre's elements in an effort to reimagine an American white male identity that might be able to hold together (or at least survive within) the multi-cultural diversity which, in the paranoid imaginings of Falling Down, threatened to tear American society apart.

## THE EMERGENCE OF CINÉMA-VÉRITÉ

Film-makers in France, Canada, and the United States led the way in theadoption ofportable, synchronous sound 16 mm. motion picture equipment; complemented by faster film stocks for indoor and night-time shooting. In the hands of innovative practitioners , this new technology resulted in departure from and transformation of pre vious documentary practice, and was given the labels 'direct cinema' , 'cinéma direct' and 'cinéma-vérité' These terms have taken different emphases, with direct cinemalcinéma direct suggesting observational methods, and cinéma-vérité a more confrontationalapproach. In practice, however, it has generally proved more useful to think of the cinéma-vérité film-maker operating as participant into the profilmic space and provokes the subject has been most characteristic of French cinéma-vérité more observational method, in contrast, has been most often championed by the Americans, particularly by a group of film-makers who worked at Drew Associates in the early

Albert and David Maysles , Hope Ryden; Joyce Chopra, and James Lipscomb.

The breakthrough film at Drew Associates and for American cinéma-vérité was Primary (1960), shot during the Wisconsin state presidential primary. The film-makers followed the two principal Democratic candidates, John F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey; and their wives as presented themselves and their viewpoints to potential The film juxtaposes two quite different kinds of personalities-the selfconfident, charming, urban sophistication of Kennedy with the folksy; antiestablishment rural the scenes' glimpse of the candidates, with the cameraman (Leacock) unobtrusively present At other points we see the candidates posing Or posed for the media\_ One implication is that we have access to the 'realKennedys while others are carefully constructed image. However; the film-makers themselves seemed well aware that their subjects were performers who were constantly shaping their own selfpresentations for others, whether for long-standing friends or for the newly portable sync-sound camera . they being seeing

American cinéma-vérité came out of journalistic impulse and has   generally been fiercely   anti-psycho: ject's outer, public shell to reveal an inner or secret self, but to capture range of self-presentations, from which the film-maker and the spectator can form an opinion of the subject. The Drew film-makers often chose performers as their subject-racing car driver Eddie Sachs in On the Pole (1960); actress Jane Fonda in Jane (1962); and the Kennedys in Crisis: Behind Presidential   Commitment (1963). They also sought to film moments of crisis situations which could produce stories with climax resolution, and ending. The crises put these people under pressure, revealing something about their judgement and ability to cope with stress, and gave the subjects some than the camera\_ By following individuals for lengthy subjects' daily existence. public again

In contrast to prior practice, cinéma-vérité film-makers in America refrained from telling the subjects what to do or

howto act; refused to 'direct' the film. Subjects would occasionally acknowledge the camera or even talk to the film-makers , but it was considered preferable for the subject to interact directly with the outside world on his terms If the subject sought direction then that wish for guidance becomes proper and revealing moment worth including in a film. The film-maker's was to respond to these presentations of self rather than to re-present, and therefore construct, the subject according to his own preconceptions. Many cinéma-vérité films refused to name was goal

American cinéma-vérité can be contrasted with the French approach championed by Jean Rouch and Edgar Morin (the sociologist who coined the phrase cinéma-vérité). In an article written in the January 1960 issue of France observateur Morin declared that a new cinéma vérité was possible' , one in which the documentary captured 'the authenticity of life as it is lived' . In this approach, the film-maker becomes an active participant and helps to create a sociodrama the camera The subject is given the chance to play out his life before the film-maker, game 'which has the value of psychoanalytic truth, that is to say precisely that which is hidden or repressed comes to the surface' The emphasis on psychology and the filmmaker's active   participation in the mise-en-scène distinguishes this approach from the observational style of the Americans for

Morin and Rouch collaborated on Chronique dun été (Chronicle of Summer, 1961), film that elaborated on insights towards the metropolitan centre. Shot in Paris and the south of France during the summer of 1960, the film employed the still emerging technology of portable cameras. For Chronique dun été, Morin and Rouch filmed a gradually widening circle of people, asking them if were and how they lived. set up scenes (Marceline walking through the Place de la Concorde and talking to herself, her dead father, and the microphone) a student from West Africa) Not only do the film-makers routinely challenge their subjects with questions and frequently appear in front of the camera, they sometimes turn their subjects series of man-in-the-street interviews and also carries the tape recorder during her monologue. At the end, those associated with the film view the edited footage and comment on what they have seen. The documentary concludes with through the Musée de lHomme and discussing the sometimes unexpected responses of their participant subjects. 'to see now that people that I like they they happy They

## 1968 AND AFTER

Theyear 1968 was the year of the Tet offensive in Vietnam of student revolts and factory occupations in France and across the world, of the Prague Spring and its repression by Soviet tanks. Among students and those concerned non-fiction film was greeted with increasing levels ofscep ticism. Documentary was seen more and more as a vehicle for expressing ideological positions. In opposition to the point of view put forward in official propaganda and on television; documentary film-makers in America and else where set out to present an alternative understanding of the Vietnam War. The veteran Joris Ivens was invited to Vietnam to make Le 1967); the North Vietnamese released Vai Toibac Cua de Quoc My (Some Evidence, 1969), which detailed the impact of American bombs and weaponry on people; animals, veg-

In 1968 and the years following, new film-making col: lectives sprang up world-wide to offer radical perspectives on the global crisis.

The extension of documentary film-making around the world was paralleled in the late 1960s by a new diversity among documentary film-makers in the west, first with States, and then with emergence of feminist and gay movements in both America and Europe. Under pressure from the Kerner Report on Civil Disorders, television stations in the USAfelt compelled to undertake a number ofinitiatives to improve the representation of the country's black and minority population Public television agreed to show Still a Brother: Inside the Negro Middle Class (1968) a documentary made by African-American film-makers William documentary   training at the Natonal Film Board of Canada, of the magazineformat television programme Black Journal (1968-70) and subsequently made a wide range of documentaries about

Latin Americans in the USA-particularly Chicanos and Puerto Ricans--were soon demanding similar access to television opportunities. Public tele vision's Realidades presented a series of controversial documentaries during its three-year run (1972-5). Film-maker José Garcia had made a pilot for the show; La carreta The oxcart' , 1970), a free 'translationJadaptation of the melodramatic play written by Puerto Rico's renowned author René Marqués .

With the resurgence of feminism in the early 1970s, many women were drawn to documentary film-making, in it a useful and accessible vehicle for campaign films and for of women's issues, often linked under the slogan 'the personal is political' .

most prominent being Helke Sander; who foregrounded women's issues in documentaries of the 1970s such as continues to do so with her historical epic Befreier und Befreite   (Liberators Take   Liberties,   1992), about German women who were raped by Soviet soldiers at the end of the Second World War. In Britain a number of feminist documentaries were produced; including pioneering exploration of women's history in Women of the Rhondda (1971), but on the whole the movement fought shy of traditional   documentary forms and focused on filmmaking practices that put both documentary and fictional images of women in question\_ beyond the bounds of feminist film-making proper; as in the Berwick Street Collective's deconstructive Nightcleaners (1975).

Third World women generally found greater opportunities decade after their  counterparts in North America and western Europe The Colombian collective Cine Mujer produced several documentaries in the 1980s, often with fictional elements, and in Brazil short documentary videos were made by Lilith Video, women's video collective; including Silvana Afram's Mulheres negras ('Black women= 1985) about racial identity and racism in 1987), composed of interviews with prostitutes.

His first documentary, Titicut Follies (1967), looked at the Massachusetts Correctional mental health facility outside Boston.

Wiseman continued to use (and to refine) his observational approach, filming, among others, a Philadelphia high school (High School, 1968) and a New York City hospital (Hospital, 1970). Appearing at the rate of roughly one per year, Wiseman's documentaries have become longer as seek to immerse audiences in his chosen milieu: Near Central Park (1990), about New York City's prize space, is a more modest 176 minutes . public

Two other leading figures in this second generation of cinéma-vérité film-makers are Roger Graef and Marcel Ophuls.

it was often theoretically fashionable to minimize or erase the distinctions between fiction and non-fiction   film-making. Quoted somewhat out of context, Christian Metz's assertion that 'every film is fiction film' , with the theoretical writings of Hayden White and Michel Foucault, fostered such an outlook. This breakdown between fiction and nonfiction modes is evident in such films as Michelle Citron's Daughter Rite (1978), and Trinh Min-ha's Surname Given Name Nam   (1989), which appear to be employing traditional interviews but in fact have actors delivering lines derived from or suggested by earlier research. Although the combining of fictive and non-staged methods has frequently produced provocative films, the tendency of the promoters of 'reality as discourse' to dismiss documentary's evidentiary function is reductive and potentially dangerous. Although documentary film-making is dependent on the film-maker's subjectivity; and the camera'$ presence does typically affect the responses of the subject, these realities do not necessarily undermine the along

MacDougall endorsed Rouch's methods , evident in Chronicle   of Summer: 'The value of a society lies as much in its dreams as in the reality it has built. Often it is only by introducing new stimuli that the investigator can peel back the layers of culture and reveal its fundamental assumptions \_ MacDougall suggested. He was surprised by 'how few of the ideas of this extraordinary film managed to penetrate the the decade after it was made" But he wanted more than just active intervention by the film-makers: 'a film-maker ized with Two Laws (1981) about Aboriginal land rights in Australia.

The participatory potential of documentary has been exploited in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as the peoples who have been the traditional subjects of ethnographic film-making have begun to make films about their own lives and cultures.

In this period, documentaries have developed in two divergent directions. While independent documentaries have flourished on the festival circuit and enjoyed critical

As in the orig inal Cabaret Voltaire, and for similar reasons, mockery and But film as an aspect of was often defiantly marginal, even after the aptly named Underground surfaced to public view in the 1960sOnly one film by the Situationist Guy Debord has been shown in Britain, for

example, at the Institute for Contemporary Arts in 1952\_

Even by then, the lead had passed to the USA, as it had with painting when New York replaced Paris as the cultural capital of modernism. As Abstract Expressionism triumphed in the 1940s, new waves of experimental filmmakers began to explore film as a fine art. More positive than the Europeans about their shared Dada-Surrealist heritage, the Americans wanted to make art, not abolish it. Their hallmark was personal vision, the basis both of

## PSYCHODRAMA AND BEYOND

Along with the revival of synaesthetic abstraction, American film-makers reinvented the narrative film-poem\_ The 'psychodrama (or 'trancefilm was modelled on dream, lyric verse, and contemporary dance. Typically; it enacts the personal conflicts of a central subject or protagonist. A scenario of desire loss, seen from the of view of a single guiding consciousness, ends either in redemption death. Against the grain of realism, montage editing evokes swift transitions in space and time\_ The action than its neutral recording agent. and point

If some Europeans were exploring the meltdown factor in mixed-media assemthe Americans wished less to blur the between the arts than freely to discover their limits. In this light, the reappearance of film drama in a cultural milieu led by purely abstract art, music, and dance is less aberrant than it looks It rehearsed the old argument between film-as-painting and as camera-eye vision; each claiming to express film's unique property as a plastic art point blage, edges form

This new narrative avant-garde was symbolized in the nowclassic Meshes of the Afternoon (1943) by Maya Deren and Alexander Hammid. Its Chinesebox narrative form entraps the young protagonist (played by Deren) as much as the disjointed domestic space around her. An emblemrecord plays in an empty room, a is off the hook. Afantasized pursuit of a glimpsed figure ends in violence, perhaps suicide. Erotic, and Freudian (despite Deren's protestation at the label), the film combines spiral structure with pictorialist camera work and intricately crafted matte shots (as when the sleeping woman faces her other 'selves who replicate within successive dreams). Both protagonist and spectator search for connecting threads; as the quest theme resonates equally in the film's subject-matter and its style phone its

non-figuration (like the Whitney brothers}   which yet others saw as denying the camera's ability to depict 'the way things are (Deren). For Deren, film had an objective aspect which the other arts innately lacked. At the same time, the manipulation of time and space was equally a property of film 'editing could undermine the surface realism of cinematography to create new language that was film's alone

This period of experimentation included the first films ofKenneth Anger, Curtis Harrington, and Sidney Peterson Their keynote was black humour and Oedipal crisis. The fleeing son of Harrington's On the Edge (1949) is literally hauled back to mother by James Broughton7 Mother's (1948) the roles ofchildren are played by adults. Peterson with San Francisco art students who were also war veterans and distorting anamorphic lens, a Californian Kali of a mother, her diver-suited son\_ and a raucous 'scratch rendition of old ballads (What's chants dissonant chorus) her Day

By contrast, the fantasy sailors of Anger's   Fireworks (1947) who savagely beat the hero are culled from Eisensteinian montage rather than the US Navy; to both of which the film pays homage along with 'American Christmas and seventeen'\_ Burning illumination leads the dreaming protagonist to trauma and death, from which he is redeemed by the seminal pouring of milk over his body and the showering of light from phallic firework The dreamer awakes to a new consciousness, still being

Marie Menken had already taken crucial step to free the camera from the centralized human eye assumed by all narrative film, even the most radical psychodramas. In accompany the Cage-Cunningham ballet The Seasons\_her hand-held camera pans round an abstract sculpture to create an improvised dance in film space. Fluently bridging the abstract and the figurative; it seeks lyric form without narrative mediation Her later experiments in the transformation of 'dailiness by camera, light, and pixillation are compiled in Notebook (1963) Menken's lib eration from film drama-unlike most of the avant-garde she was painter; not a writer-inspired the young Stan Brakhage to adopt the free camera work of his transitional Anticipation of the Night (1958)

Deren and Anger also moved away from psychodramain the 1950s. Their films became more gestural and abstract. Both were drawn to magic and became experts on their founding Haitian Voudoun for Deren and Aleister in a tradition which gave primacy to photogenic sight and montage structure. Anger stressed the first of these, most myths,

elaborately in his Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome (195466), which occupied him for most of the 1950s and which he issued projection-over twenty years. Dissolves and superimpositions of the Magus's sparkling and regalia orgiastic initiation rite, in which masks, bodyto deflate and ironize the film's high mannerist style. rings

Myth and dance were central to both Anger and Deren\_ her psychodrama Ritual in Transfigured Time (1949), in which Anaïs Nin also appears Here, a cocktail party becomes children's game (by freeze-frame rhythms) statues come alive (by stopmotion) and the two female protagonists-played by Deren and the black actress Rita Christiani-change identities in an underwater closing tive trilogy

Her final films no longer psychologize the trance state \_ In Meditation on Violence (1953), trance is embodied in the balletic ritual gestures of a Chinese ritual boxer. His slowbuilding solo performance displays the sinuous geometry of unarmed combat, to flute music. The pace quickens with drumbeats until a sudden montage cut from interior to rooftop shows the whirling boxer now with robes and sword. The first sequence is repeated, this time in almost imperceptible reverse-motion. Overshadowed by her early look even further ahead in their hybrid mixture of cultures and in Deren's explicit articulation of a woman's voice' they

After spending the 1950s in Europe where he made the strangely baroque Eaux d'artifice (1953) and started work on other projects, he returned to America where he made a surprising (and for him unique) turn to contemporary life\_vividly mythologized-in Scorpio Rising (1964), response to the new rock and youth culture he found there after his fifteen-year absence This heralded for Anger were encoded in the narcissistic rites of the 'bike boy' cult.

The roots of the Underground which flowered in the 1960s in the aftermath of world war. During the early 1950s films were made in France by fringe dissidents, hostile to the 'culture industry' . The assault on culture began with the Lettriste group in Paris led by lsidore lsou from 1947.Its attacks on meaning and value look back to Rimbaud, Nietzsche, and Dada, and anticipate William Burroughs. Among their tactics of 'détourcommercial found footage literally to pieces, scratching and painting the film surface and frame, adding texts and sound-tracks to dislocate its original meaning further These often very long works joined a Lettriste armoury of collage-poems, manifestos; and provocations lay

In Vienna, radical artists in the immediate post-war were similarly hostile to the 'commodification of art but did not reject artistic activity (as the Situationists did). One Viennese group included the artists and filmmakers Felix Radax, Peter Kubelka, and Arnulf Rainer. Their experiments with formal and mathematical systems drew on Webern and the pre-war Vienna School, as in Arnulf   Rainer   (1958-60) used graphic score to pre determine its alternating patterns of black and white frames, while Adebar (1957) and Schwechater (1958) employ cyclic repetition of small human movements and fluid colours. Several of Kubelka's films were commissioned, in spite of their purist ambitions: Adebar, with its strobe flattened dancers , was an advert for a café of that name period

Another group; which included Kurt Kren, was attracted to the idea of confrontational 'live-art' performance, as practised by Hermann Nitsch and Otto Muehl under the banner of 'Material-Action' Kren recorded Muehl's transgressive events in films which simultaneously explore per which permutate shots in a strict series (TV, 1967), Or use rapid motion and cutting (48 Faces from the Szondi Test, 1960). Yet others take new look at the everyday, as in the witty and selfexplanatory Eating; Drinking; Pissing and Shitting Film (1967), or view nature through time-lapse and (1975).

Underground film in the USA at first encompassed documentary and narrative fiction, and extending beyond the bounds of the artistic avant-garde in the narrow sense\_ Spontaneity and improvisation were the keynote, with frequent recourse to cinéma-vérité techniques, as in the early work of John Cassavetes and that of Shirley Clarke, a former dancer who turned from dance films to making features such as The Connection (1960 Theatre) and The Cool World (1962). In 1960 \_ the New York artists' avant-garde joined with these other independents to form the New American Cinema Group: polished, slick films-we prefer them ing far Living

Equally playful and anecdotal is quasi-narrative Beat film The Flower Thief (1960), starring Taylor Mead. looser narratives were soon abandoned Rice's Chumlum (1964) and Jack Smith's Flaming Creatures (1963) visually celebrate the as bouffe, shot in delirious dissolved colour outdated stock (by Smith) opéra (by pallid

'Action painting' also impelled film to an involvement with process and with gestural, mixed-media live art, pioneered by Jacobs, Smith, and (later) Warhol\_ An important films (1962-6) are typically tongue-incheek explorations of extreme close-up (Chieko Shiomi's Disappearing Music for Face-a slow-motion smile) permutation (Yoko Ono's Bottoms' eraless films (George Maciunas), single-frame films (Paul Sharits) and banalized humour (George Landow's The Evil Faerie)

The magazine Film Culture was founded by Jonas Mekas in 1955 to support the new documentary and fiction film, along with the smaller group of experimental film artists narrative branches of New American Cinema were committed to forms of realism which the artists' avant-garde rejected. By 1962 the balance of forces had swung the other way for Mekas, and his magazine was thereafter devoted mainly (but not exclusively) to the experimental film, post-Deren and as was his influential column in the Village   Voice.

In similar vein, Bruce Conner made films archive footage. His milestone work is A Movie (1958) which moves from the hilarious (crazy races, a chase scene with cars and cowboys) disturbing (shivering refugees, an by the film's montage just as it plays on a movie" as both kinetic event and emotional affect.

## Andy Warhol (1927-1987)

Born Andrew Warhola in Cleveland, Ohio,in 1927,Andy Warhol studied art at the Camegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, then moved to New York in 1949 where he worked as a graphic artist and window display decorator. Warbol became the central figure in pop art, his work representing stract Expressionism's still-romantic idealization of the freedom and expressivity of a strong and lonely heroic subjectivity. Warhol celebrated the mass-produced ob jects and images of modern culture.

Warhol's art was already deeply influenced by Hollywood as an industry and a social phenomenon when he started making flms. His references to mass-produced heroes Superman and Baunan, and stars like Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe. His portraits of celebrities not only reproduced Hollywood glamour shots, they often included a serial repetition whích reproduced the Warhol reappropriated reproducible images under his own signature in order both to borrow and to point up

In Anticipation of the Night (1958), this concern for poetic myth and illumination was displaced on to the formal plane of light and colour; away from fictional diegetic space and the singular narrative subject.

Lyric films-short, poetic, and visual-flourished in this decade, particularly on the west coast, where Bruce Baillie matted and superimposed the stately freight trains of

Castro Street (1966). But for some newer film-makers, in the run-up to post-painterly abstraction and minimal art\_ both the lyric mode and Brakhage's visibly hand-held camera (index or trace of the artist's response to experience) were too uncritically subjective The main mentor of the anti-subjective approach (and of the shortly whose brief film-making career dated from 1963 and whose urban, disengaged, and impersonal art challenged Brakhage's take no editing-opposed current avant-garde styles and were a direct attack on film as dream and metaphor.

Warhol's objective camera-eye inspired a turn towards the material aspect of film. With loopprinting, repetition, and blank footage devices unique to the film medium Warhol made works of extreme duration. He also subtly manipulated time, questioning the seeming simplicity of the long take.

## STRUCTURAL FILM

Structural film led the avant-garde to the high ground, seeking to explore visual ideas of structure, process; and chance then appearing in the other arts (Cage; Rausensation and towards self-reflexiveness. In structural film form became content\_ A cinema of vision was replaced by one which posited viewing as an act of reading (literally Landow) shifting the experimental film into a new philo sophical territory.

Canadian artist Michael Snow was an early exponent of this new approach. His best-known film, Wavelength (1967), explores the illusion of space. For forty-five minutes, a camera slowly and irregularly zooms into the far wall and windows of a loft, accompanied by a sine wave The zoom is interrupted by colour changes induced by (a conversation, hammed death, phone call) which the lens literally passes over in casually anti-narrative ofsea waves. A decade later, Snow issued its short counterpart; Breakfast (1972-6), wbere the camera pushes slowly across a breakfast table and observation turns into intervention as it snags the tablecloth and gradually smashes all before it. deep rising

Snow continued his perceptual and time-based experiments with La Région centrale (1971) in which a remote control camera pans and pivots endlessly over a mountain landscape. In the labyrinthine Rameau's Nephew (1974) he takes another tack, exploring different literal structures one sequence, actors speak their lines backwards to imitate a tape played erally  taken apart (by forklift trucks) and in So Is This (1982), which is wholly made up of words and phrases interrogating the act of watching the film. they

Also Iike Snow. Frampton was attracted to the idea of making films on grand scale, mirroring in duration the late 1970s he embarked on project, unfinished by his death in 1984, for an epic of films, one for each of the year; entitled The Straits of Magellan. A late example of the American sublime, its grand scale ironically incorporates the ideas on serial minimalism Frampton discussed in the early 1960s with the young sculptor with Carl Andre, when both artists were seeking to undermine pop art. cycle day

Few film-makers approved of the term structural flm' . introduced in the early 1970s by the critic P.Adams Sitney to describe post-Warholian film-making in which 'the film insists on its shape, and what content it has is minimal and subsidiary to its outline' . Perhaps fearing an onrush

Chris Welsby's Park Film (1972) uses time-lapse to compress three days on a walkway into six minutes of film time. Such films sought film equivalents for natural light and motion aimed to renew perception by using the whole register of film language, underlining its normally invisible aspects (frame; surface, print stock) and its 'mistakes (flare, slippage; double exposure). For Le Grice, this constituted a 'politics of perception' (he hopefully titled a series of films in the early 1970s How to Screw the CIA). The 'pure' landscape films of Raban and Mike Leggett (The Sheepman and the Sheared, 1970-5) also allude to the passage of historical time, later explored by Raban in the neo-documentary Thames Film 1992).

## PRIMITIVES AND POST-STRUCTURALISTS

In both the USA and Europe, the avant-garde's interest in early film form coincided with revisionist history of the primitive era. Historians as well as film-makers saw primitive cinema as an alternative to the mainstream, not just an ancestor. These interests coincided between 1977 and 1984. as a 'new film history' emerged alongside coverAfterimage to Studio International and Art Forum. These conjunctions are heralded in Ken Jacobs's deconstructionist the Pper's Son   (1969-71), which scrutinizes texture and motion in a 1905 Billy Bitzer film; re-shooting from the screen expands it from four minutes to two hours. Equally ambitious, Klaus Wyborny's Birth of a Nation (1973) explores pre-Griffith film space, here reduced to few actors in a bare landscape. The viewer is kept at distance by shot and ellipsis. In Brakhage's Murder Psalm (1981), an instructional film is re-cut and tinted to evoke an eerie childhood dream\_ The austere and magisterial Eureka (1974) by Ernie Gehr simply slows down an long

By scanning early films, Jacobs and Gehr sought to unlock their meanings by a process of self-revelation. European film-makers showed less respect for the authority of early footage.

Clandestine love between warder and prisoner is evoked in high symbolism (hands pass rose between barred windows) and grainy realism (men in cells) It inspired a new 'cinema of transgression' , promoted by the charismatic Derek Jarman and seen notably in the early Dream Machine (1984)

## EXPERIMENTAL ANIMATORS

A small number of experimental animators had already enjoyed an alternative community for some decades, as part of experimental art film The presence of Oskar Fischinger in Los Angeles encouraged the brothers John and James Whitney to turn from music and painting to the creation of abstract animation, with hard-edged geometric imagery synchronized to astonishing 'electronic the San Francisco Museum of Art held the first of some Art in Cinema festivals   which screened classic avant-garde films of the 1920s (Buñuel \_ Man Cocteau) beside new the This encouraged two other young painters, mation; Belson favoured dynamic polymorphous colour manifestations (Allures, 1961; Samadhi, 1967; Light, 1973) while Smith tended toward geometric forms, at first handpainted on the film strip (Film No. 1 and 2, 1947-9) then later composed by the superimposition of preanimated melodic units in live, multiple-projector performance dozen Ray,

Fischinger; James Whitney; Belson; and Smith were all devoted to mystical, spiritual ideals. Smith combined his abstract imagery with sacred representational figures cut out from nineteenth-century lithographs and animated in intricate synchronization to the music of Thelonius Monk and Dizzy Gillespie (Film No. 10 and No. 11, 1955). While these four artists formed the core of a 'California School of Color Music' , by 1957 Art in Cinema festivals had shown abstract films by seventeen other west coast

This tradition of abstract animation continues unbroken to the present, with artists like Jules Engel who Academy Award nomination for the 1963 Icarus Montgolfier Wright) has created some thirty abstract animations. These to dynamic studies in kineticism (Rumble, 1975) and handdrawn parallels to canvas paintings (Villa Rospigliosi, 1988) and are all infused with fine conceptual wit. Computer artists Larry Cuba (Two Space, 1978) and David Brody (Beethoven   Machinery; 1989) control the complex potential of their technology to produce a subtle visual music; while artists like Sara Petty (Preludes in Magical Time, 1987) and Dennis Pies (Luma Nocturna, 1974) continue to render thousands of delicate drawings for each film. his

Other abstract animation artists fourished in various locations The New Zealander Len Lye created the 1928 Tusalava (drawings and cutouts) in London and the 1958 Free Radicals (scratched directly on black film) in New York. He made ten other abstract between, while working for the British GPO unit (A Colour Box painted on film in 1935,and Trade Tattoo, optically printed live action and abstraction together; 1937) Or supporting himself with painting, sculpture, and commercials. In Ohio and New York; painter Dwinell Grant made nine abstract films (including Themis; 1940; Stereoscopic Composition; 1945; Composition 6 'Dream Fantasies' , 1985) while supporting himself by designing for the theatre and animating medical films.

Norman McLaren enjoyed the greatest career of any of these experimental animators. In 1933, as an art student, he drew an abstraction directly on the film-strip. John Grierson hired him to work at the GPO film unit in London; and there he did such diverse as shooting documentary film about the Spanish Civil and drawing directly on film a surrealist ad for airmail, Love on the (1939).

Beginning with his first film in 1964, almost every one of his animations won major festival prizes. The 1971 Jabberwocky consists primarily of genuine Victorian toys interacting in combinations that suggest the cruelty and sexuality inherent in Lewis Carroll's classic tales.

## FEATURES

Other than television production (including sit-com series like The Simpsons, commercials, and MTV rock videos) features are the only area in which industrial animation still flourishes , because cinemas can accommodate them Hundreds have been produced, from most countries of the world, but few of these enjoyed success, perhaps because animation needs special qualities and develop ment to maintain audience interest for more than an hour. Experimental features, like Borowczyk's 1967 Théâtre grotesque graphics, are often too bizarre and demanding for the prolonged concentration of all but a few. However; have limited   audience; numerous Disney-imitation fairy-talelanimal features have had too little charm OI intricacy to sustain interest (some shipwreck on the Disney convention of musical numbers)and even Disney itself suffered from recherché banality in its 1970s features (Robin Hood might just as well have been live-action)

## NEW TECHNOLOGIES

New technology and contemporary art trends have altered The rise of 'Performance Art' found its echo in the animation world in the work of artists such as Kathy Rose and Dennis Pies, who danced live with film material animated for performance Video technology improved enough for animators to shoot frame-by-frame directly on exclusively on video (Henry Selick's 1989 Slow Bob in the Lower Dimensions contracted and 'video seems film.

Early experimental computer graphics were costly and time-consuming, and produced awkward and simplistic gifted artist, like Peter Foldes, could realize how to exploit this for representational figures-as seen in his biting 1974 film Hunger. By the mid-1980s, improvements in imaging technology allowed artists to simulate three-dimensional to provide only glossy limited colours. Again, particular artist-John Lasseter; who had studied traditional character animation at California Institute of the Arts-had the artistic imagination to couple these potentials with story that suited them: two desklamps, mother and son, disagree about playing ball. The film, Luxo Jr. (1986) won at Annecy, Berlin and Hiroshima as well as gaining an Oscar nomination prizes

Origins of a New Art.

## Modern Film Music

Early in the sound era, film-makers established a norm for musical scoring which, by 1960, had changed very little That norm dictated the use of musical cues kept outside the narrative universe (the diegesis) and specifically tailored to the action of a particular film. It also dictated that the musical styles derive from those of 'classical" music which might be   simply defined as music, generally intended for the concert hall, that stands in opposition to the more popular forms of the art, whether songs, dance

period onward, were showing up in some film score or another. Perhaps more significantly; other musical exclusively either as diegetic ('source') music or in musicals, played alarger and larger role in background scoring. evolutions in audience taste and profile, (2) greater comareas of marketing, such as sound recordings, and (3) greater aesthetic influence on the part of non-Hollywood filmmaking, particularly from Europe

## ROMANTICISM

interactions that prevailed up to 1960 continued to mani-

fest themselves at least two more decades, albeit with interesting shifts in aesthetic motivation. Lush, Romantic been popular for decades; some themes, such some without, such as Erich Korngold's 1938 The Adventures technologies of sound recording and, in some theatres playback. This can be seen as one of the major stimuli for the very tonal orchestral bombast and big themes Maurice Jarre scored for David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and Doctor Zhivago (1965). An emerging politics of nostalgia in the United States also played major role in the selfconscious return Korngold in John Williams's score for Star Wars (1977), which established out. More subtle forms of Romanticism and more creative uses in large instrumental   settings also appeared, frequently for films of literary inspiration and in scores that also featured more modernistic writing in toral music composed by Richard Rodney Bennett for Far from the Madding Crowd (John Schlesinger; 1967) and Lady Caroline Lamb (Robert Bolt, 1972), or the more autumnal, bittersweet score by veteran Franz Waxman for Hemfor

(1964). However, by the 1960s, modern musical styles had become more of the norm, as the models provided by lateRomantic, middle-European composers were giving way to more characteristically twentieth-century sounds, and thing that raised Stanley Kubrick's 1960 Spartacus  above William Wyler's biblical epic Ben-Hur, which preceded it by a year, was its score by Alex North, with its harmonically violent brass and wind configurations; and its jarring and rhythmically inventive percussion figures. Aaron Copland defi nitely influenced much of the Americana heroism evoked 1960), while there is more than a hint of Benjamin Britten writing for Jerry Goldsmith's The Blue Max (John Guillermin, 1966) Stravinsky shows up in many of the orchestral concoctions and the choral chanting of Goldsmith 's influential score for the satanistic thriller The Omen (Richard Donner; 1976). Stravinsky's presence can be felt in numerous post-1960 scores, including such homages as Jerry Fielding's Straw (Sam Peckinpah, scoreS by Fielding. A more light-hearted style, recalling Prokofiev; shows up in Goldsmith's The Great Train Robbery (Michael Crichton, 1979). More recent composers have also continued to work in modernistic, big orchestra idiom; 1989) and Dead Again (Branagh, 1991), and George Fenton Angels (Neil Jordan, 1989). string Dogs

In France the action-specific cue often gave way to broader musical canvases whose lyricism served more as an emotional counterbalance than as complement to tragic scores for such New Wave' melodramas as Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt (Le Mépris, 1963) and François Truffaut's La Peau douce ('Silken skin' , 1964). Amore dramaticcontrast between score and action was found in Italy; where the prolific Ennio Morricone began a series of 'spaghetti Western' scores that   usually include extended bel canto melodic lines; often intoned by a vocalizing soprano. Two of the Cera una volta il west (Once upon a Time in the West, 1968) and Giù la known as A Fistful of Dynamite, 1972), stand in stark contrast to the brutality of the films' action.

## MODERNISM

More modern musical styles had been used in early Hollywood and elsewhere to back darker dramatic action: whether in Max Steiner's often primitivistic music for (1933), or in Miklós Rózsa's stark, morbid dissonances for Double Indemnity (1945). This tendency continued into the 1960s and beyond: in the non-resolving dissonances in barely tonal harmonic contexts of Bernard Herrmann 's athematic score for Psycho (1960), or in the brittle orchestrations and acidic harmonic style composed by Dmitri Shostakovich for Grigory Kozintsev's Hamlet King Kong

a modern\_ 'classical" style also discovered that ensembles smaller than the standard OI fifty-piece orchestra could be used to provide effective backing for certain films. For instance, in the same year that Maurice Jarre over whelmed film-goers with big-theme orchestral bombast poignancy and nostalgia of Robert Mulligan's To Kill Mockingbird by featuring simple themes played by small In France, Pierre Jansen wrote mostly nontonal set of cues for piano, violin, and cello that not only mirror the love triangle of Claude Chabrol's La Femme infidèle (The unfaithful woman' , 1968) but also communicate the austerity of the murderous husband's lifestyle. For the villain in Chabrol's flamboyant melodrama dissonant theme played by a quartet. This style was employed into the 1980s, for instance in Per Nørgaard's quiet score for Gabriel Axel's Babette's Feast (1987), with its violin-viola-cello-piano quartet. fortychoppy string

## ADVANCED MODERNISM

advanced 'classical' techniques also began to be used more widely in film scoring around 1960, almost invariably for films dealing with and sombre sub jects. Indeed, flm scores, which most audiences listened to with only half an ear, gave certain composers chance to experiment; chance would not have had were the concert hall. In 1955 Leonard Rosenman provided mainstream cinema's first atonal score based around Schoenbergian tone row, Vincente Minnelli's Freudian drama The Cobweb He did More grim they they for

On the other hand, post-Schoenbergian techniques and other advanced forms of modernism fared somewhat better. In post-1960 films with darker narrative bases, one often which short, athematic fragments set in discontinuous instrumental contexts replace the more developed themes and more fluid of traditional   scoring. example, the music by David Amram that appears shortly into the Korean action of the pre-title sequence for The Manchurian Candidate (1962) creates its military aura For War

For Franklin J Schaffner's 1968 Planet of the Apes, Jerry Goldsmith deployed such 'instruments' and instrumental effects as tuned \_ aluminium mixing bowls, a bass slide whistle, a triangle stick scraped over a gong a ram's horn, air blown through brass instruments with inverted mouthpieces,  all to produce musical moods that simultaneously evoke both the modern and the primitive One of the most important deployments of modernistic devices can be found in John Williams's music Robert Altman's 1972 Images , film that examines the schizophrenic breakdown of married woman. Williams's music mirrors the split between the heroine's creative and sexual sides, although in ways more subtle than one might expect On the one hand, the composer offers tonal, very minor-mode, almost dirge-like theme heard on solo piano backed principally by On the other hand, Williams engaged Japanese percussionist Stomu Yamashta to perform in various non-tonal, all but arhythmic cues that burst violently on to the music track throughout the film.

A major avant-garde mode of 'classical' composition that developed after the Second World War was electronic music . Although certain primitive electronic instruments, in particular the Theremin and the Ondes Martenot, had already made their way into film composing, a style grew up in the early 1950s that involved the use of oscillators, filters, and other sound generators. Sounds obtained in this manner, combined with sounds recorded both from musical instruments and large variety of other sources (musique concrète), often electronically modified, were painstakingly edited on to magnetic tape into musical compositions. By far the best-known film score created in this manner was made by Louis and Bebe Barron for Forbidden Planet (1956). This method of composing had little future outside avant-garde film-making. However, the electronic pioneer Vladimir Ussachevsky did score one narrative film, although hardly mainstream one: the 1962 version of Sartre's bleak, existential parable No Exit, directed by Tad Danielewski; in which, along with various electronically generated timbres, Ussachevsky introduces such concrete' sounds as a tape-loop of wind, a crackling fire, a ticking clock, grunting, and rifle fire hogs

The tonal distortion convincingly delineates Arkin's disturbed psychoneurotic personality; (Bazelon 1975). The 'out of tune' note Bazelon refers to is in traditional western music whose smallest interval is the half-tone. Mancini used quarter-tones even more elab orately in Laslo Benedek's The Night Visitor (1970), about a mental-institution escapee out on The cold sound obtained by the composer came from seventeen-piece wind and keyboard ensemble with two and two harpsichords tuned at quarter-tone to each other. pianos

## ELECTRONIC MUSIC

Also interesting for their use of electronic music are the collaborations between director-writer Alain RobbeGrillet and composer Michel Fano. In the director's various attempts to redefine the cinematic language, they merged sound- and music tracks into a kind of ongoing musique concrète that helped free both the sound- and music tracks from what Robbe Grillet refers to as the 'ideology of realism' In The Man who Lies (LHomme Fano's sparsely used, avant-garde music is only one part of the overall partition sonore (sound score) which also qui

The 1960s saw the arrival Prophet, contained unit, offered many of the sounds and timbre manipulations previously obtainable only through trial and error in the laboratory. In certain cases, these instruments were used to replace earlier electronic instruments. Moog pioneer Walter (later Wendy) Carlos composed some purely synthesized cues for Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange (1971), also synthesizer to create mod renof some of the film's classical music. To suggest the tortured interactions of mental energies in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981), composer Howard Shore twelve hours of improvisation synthesizer on to a twenty-four-track tape recorder; building up complex layers of sound that he later added to and recorded with some written down cues for acoustic orchestra.

The arrival of synthesizers has had a great impact on film music. Since synthesizers have often replaced entire on some music tracks, their financial implications have been  considerable.  Requiring technical expertise and trained ear; more than traditional musical training, synthesizers have also opened Carpenter scored or co-scored many of his works; notably where the simplistic but devastatingly gripping suspense-thriller narrative was comp lemented by an equally simplistic-and equally gripping \_ electronic score

In the early 1980s, even more sophisticated electronics based on modern computer technologies came to play a ible to produce flute timbres, for instance, on guitar-like instruments, while pre-programming allowed for the creation of complex rhythmic   patterns. Electronic wind instruments (EWIs), electronic drums, and allsorts of boards have become commonplace in film-studio ensembles, and rare is the contemporary film score, even when written mostly for a full symphony orchestra, into which electronic timbres do not merge at some point. The composer Maurice Jarre, formerly proponent of the big orchestral sound, turned almost exclusively to electronics in his most recent film scores (such as the hallucinatory Jacob's Ladder, directed by Adrian Lyne in 1990), in which ments as a kind of chamber group. Jerry Goldsmith's more sophisticated, more modernistic harmonic language has worked particularly well in electronic scores such as the moody music for Criminal Law {Martin Campbell, 1989) and the more violent strains for Michael Crichton's Runaway (1984), which Goldsmith performed on Yamaha digital key-

keyboards programmed by his son, Joel Goldsmith. In a more popular vein, Mancini, for Blake Edwards's Switch (1991), used two synthesizers. two EWIs. electronic drums, electronic guitar; and only one 'acoustic instrument. Henry

## MINIMALISM

Although non-melodic in the traditional sense and compositional cells that are basically fragments, minimalism stands against avant-garde techniques by using tonal harmonies and by deploying these fragments in hypnotically repeated loops. These redefine musical time not by pointillistically breaking it down but by expanding it to such that it seems to dissolve the linear confines of physical space and chronological time This style is used by Philip Glass in his non-stop musical backof non-narrative examinations of landscapes and people-scapes, Koyaanisqatsi (1983), Powaqqatsi (1988), and Anima mundi (1992). Glass scores also appear on the music tracks of Paul Schrader's stylized portrayal of Yukio Mishima in Mishima (1985), and in which the music complements an almost childlike visual style. using point ings trilogy

Greenaway's partnership with Nyman remains one of the most current cinema. tably Henry

JAZZ

Around 1960, film music also began to turn towards noncinema. The 1950s saw jazz appear in scores, almost all of them tied in This music was written both by established film composers such as Alex North (A Streetcar Named Desire; Elia Kazan, 1951), Elmer Bernstein (The Man the Golden Arm; Otto Preminger; 1955), David Raksin (The  Big Combo; Joseph Lewis , and Henry Mancini (Touch of Evil; Orson 1958) and by major jazz musicians, including Miles Malle, 1957), Duke Ellington (Anatomy of Murder; Otto Preminger, 1959), and John Lewis (Odds against Tomorrow; Robert Wise 1959). with

In this score and others, Schifrin creates classical idioms; film scoring has provided him with the opportunity and the liberty to create this style. John Barry contributed bouncy score for Richard Lester's comedy The Knack and How to Get It (1965) and some haunting night jazz for Lester's disturbing Petulia (1968). Barry's jazz and pop training also shows up in the often brassy cues for his numerous James Bond scores, including the orchestration of the famous 'James Bond Theme' , but many of his 007 cues also move into more purely Lovely (1975) has Gershwin-influenced classical-jazz elegance, while Shire's darker music for the 1974 thriller The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (Joseph Sargent) audaciously offers atonal figures played over traditional jazz, Latin-flavoured accompaniment   figures.

## NEW FILM/MUSIC INTERACTIONS

One of the most important developments in film scoring after 1960 took place, not in the type of scores appearing, but in the relationship between the music and the film. By 1960,the quality of recorded sound, both in the movies and in the various audio formats, had caught up with the visual qualities of the cinema. Furthermore, formal changes were occurring in areas like the 'New Wave' in France that accelerated the release of other elements of the film-making process from subordination to the narrative; the visual image, the sound, and the music became significant elements in their own right. For Pierrot le fou 'themes' , which the director then used not as action-specifc cues but as form of imaged material just as subject to cutting and editing as the visual images .

One of the results of thesetendencies was the elevation, in certain films, of the music track to the status of another

Two prominen examples of this are the 1967 Swedish film Elvira Madigar directed by Bo Widerberg, and Stanley Kubrick's pior eering 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). To complement th often pastoral photography and the love-tragedy narrativ of Elvira Madigan, Widerberg turned to excerpts from thi secondmovementofMozart's twenty-first Piano Concerto the cinema, but as a musical image running parallel to and expressing, what was expressed elsewhere ir the visualand narrative images.

A new twist in film scoring has been the intrusion intc the narrative universe of music previously restricted tc audience music's movielike status as major cultura] provider of images. It is within this   perspective, instance, that one can the hoodlum's addiction, in Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange , to 'Ludwig van and other classical composers whose music wanders in and out of the film's diegesis. Jean-Jacques Beineix's Diva (1982) which gave world-wide recognition to an aria from La Wally; a previously obscure opera by Alberto Catalani, has as its central point of inquiry the very status ofmusic as image. The appearance in Tony Scott's The Hunger (1983) of the aria 'Viens, Malika" not only helped to get the work back on the boards in New York, but turned the aria, like the aria from La Wally; into something of music-track staple both for TV comRidley Scott's Someone to Watch over Me (1987), Tony Scott's True Romance (1993), and Brian De Palma's Carlito's (1993). Music, and its quasi-addictive powers as an escapist image, also play a major role in several of the black comedies directed by Bertrand Blier, most notably Préparez vos mouchoirs (Get by the film's two male protagonists ultimately loses out to the Schubert favoured by their teenage rival. from Way

musicals or to be used as 'source' (diegetic) music, popular songs. whether already written or composed specially for given film, began to interact in deeper ways with the visual and narrative content of certain films. Elaborate title sequences often such as John Barry's title song belted out by Shirley Bassey; for Goldfinger (1964) or Michel Legrand 's 'The Windmills of your Mind' for Norman Jewison 's The Thomas Crown Affair 'Everybody's Talkin" became the theme song for John Schlesinger's Midnight   Cowboy (1969) songs also appeared on non-diegetic music tracks to back sig nificant-often romanticmoments Examples of this would include Burt Bacharach's 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and Barry's 'We Have All the Time in the World' (sung by Louis Armstrong) for On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). music also fines of the pop tune. In order to create a musical parallel the autobiographical dramas of certain films by Federico Fellini, such as 84 (1963) Juliet of the Spirits (Giulietta degli spiriti, 1965), and Amarcord (1974), Nino Rota devised unique musical style incorporating foxtrots , marches, Pop Pop for

Obvious examples include the three Head status of these groups pushed the writers and directors of their films towards free-form, occasionally psychedelic (particularly in Yellow Submarine and Head) visual and narrative style.

The new types of interactions between film and pop music that arose in the 1960s spelled the demise of the film musical by 1970. The only survivors were the animated features of the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as Beauty and the Beast (1991), with music and songs by Alan Menken and lyrics by Howard Ashman Disney

By the 1980s, cine-popmusic strategies often involved slipping as many already recorded songs as possible on to given film's music track, generally as source music, in order to attract younger audiences and to generate audio recordings that recycled these songs on to albums billed as 'original sound-tracks' The most common venue for original songs, generally performed by popular recording stars and often totally out of sync with the mood of the film, has become the endcredit sequences that are now permanent fixture in the cinema.

## Art Cinema

At the beginning of the 1960s the prospects for European cinema looked Although audiences were declining, types of cinema were emerging which took account of the broader international market, while the French New Wave showed the way in low-budget film-making which did not need large audiences to cover its costs. By the 1980s, however; the picture was distinctly less rosy; The new cinemas of the 1960s and early 1970s ran out of steam. Cinema audiences declined still further, often vertiginously. Hollywood tightened its grip over the major film markets, and seized increasing share of dwindling boxoffice revenues. In many European countries, particularly the smaller ones, the making of homegrown   popular crime films, and other traditional bread-and-butter genres-dwindled to trickle, and production became sporadic, sustained by subsidy and the occasional international success. National cinemas in either the economic or the cultural sense-that is to say, cinemas capable of producing a regular crop of films for the national market addressing national cultural concerns-now exist in only handful of European countries; west or (since the fall of Communism) east.

As result, European cinema is increasingly characcinema' and (at the upper end) as 'international film These categories fairly accurately reflect the situation that has come into being since the 1980s, but the notion of art cinema in   particular can when applied re trospectively to   European films of earlier periods. Many of the films marketed in Britain and America under the 'art cinema' label, and imagined to be somehow different from commercial films, were in fact (and sometimes still are) mainstream products in their country of origin, enjoying success at home before sold abroad more restricted 'art-house" release, and the same is true of Japanese and Indian films. art popular being for

## THE NEW ART CINEMA

The idea of an art film' (or film d'art) occupying an differenteconomic and culturalspace from run of-the-mill commercial   production is almost as films with superior (or at any rate distinctive) artistic qualities could be an industrial strategy for pro ducers and entrepreneurs as well as an aesthetic aim for directors-though both sides often discovered, to their cost, that the two objectives were not necessarily compatible. After 1945, government policy in many countries old Making

specifically favoured the making of films that would serve as vehicles of national cultural expression. Though these policies were often ambiguous; both in intention and in effect, opened up spaces in which non-mainstream film-making could be financially viable, if not a reliable source of they

The new 1960s was not a homogeneous phenomenon. It comprised the cheaply made and often playful films of the French New Wave and solemn super-productions such as Visconti's The Leopard made in Italy but financed by 2Oth Century-Fox. Within the New Wave itself, different tendencies emerged . Some directors, such as Jean-Luc Godard retained commitment to radical   experiment, while others , such as Claude Chabrol , moved increasingly towards the genre film (in Chabrol's case, the Hitchcock thriller) Whichever route directors chose, however, could find producers to back them; secure in the knowledge that the market was flexible enough to support many different types of film, for both domestic and international release. In Britain market conditions were less favourable. The directors from the 'Free Cinema stable were more dependent on mainstream releasing; although they enjoyed some international prestige, their main road to success was via America rather than Europe\_ art they

The turning-point for European art cinema came in 1959-60, with the release of Truffaut's Les Quatre cents coups, Alain mon Fellini's La dolce vita. The cultural   conditions for the initially through the work of film societies and smallcirculation magazines, and harbingers of the explosion to come could be found in the enthusiastic reception given to films like Ingmar Bergman But the popular appeal of the New Wave and associated 'Art' than on features such as their openness to a variety of experiences and (compared with mainstream British codes) their sexual frankness \_ This appealed in particular to the young, educated audiences which were becoming proportionately more important with demographic and cultural change.

In Italy the novelist and essayist Pier Paolo Pasolini turning to film-making as an alternative mode for the expression ofhis ideas on myth and contemporary politics and culture. In France two protagonists of the nouveau roman, Marguerite Duras and Alain Robbe-Grillet, both of whom had written scripts for Resnais (Duras for Hiroshima mon amour in 1959 and Robbe Grillet for Last Year in Marienbad in 1961), went on to the potential of film narrative as directors in their own right. With his return to Europe from Mexico in the early 1960s, the exiled Spanish director Luis Buñuel embarked on series of films which in line with his long-standing commitment to Surrealism, defied and undermined conventional morality and narrative logic alike explore

The 1960s was also the periodof authorship, or the film d'auteur. Hollywood films were increasingly recognized (and advertised) as the work of their directors, although the concept of the director as author had no legal status within the Hollywood production   system. In   Europe, where they had long enjoyed greater control of their work new audience to present films which were intellectually challenging as well as shocking.

In the words of French philosopher Gilles Deleuze; the movement-image gave way to the time-image. Experience of space and time was allowed to prevail over the pressure of narrative development expressed through conventional procedures number of directors-notably and the Brazilian Glauber Rocha (Antonio das Mortes, 1969)based their narratives around a systematic use of take in which the atmosphere built up steadily over period of time and was broken only occasionally by even more rarely, move into close-up. By contrast (though sometimes in conjunction) with the image-based approach other directors   used voice-over and various forms of verbal interpolation to the evidence of the image. The laid-back, observational style of Antonioni is in sharp opposition to the interventionist   approach of Godard while some directors, such as Truffaut or Fellini, between one approach and the other. long moved

## AN INTERLUDE: MAY 1968 AND POLITICAL CINEMA

Even before the climactic moment of 1968 new radical climate was making itself felt in the cinema, sharpened by opposition to the American war in Vietnam: A foretaste of what was to come was the compilation film Far from Vietnam (Loin du Viêt-Nam, 1967) which brought together   veteran documentarist Joris Ivens, American independent William Klein, and representatives from the Agnès Varda, and, unlikeliest ofall, the highly commercial Claude Lelouch-to launch a combined protest against the conduct of the war. Already before that, Godard, whose sympathies had seemed until then to lie with the political right, had begun working references to the Vietnam War into the disjointed texture of his films with beginning Pierrot le fou in 1965. Godard went on, with La Chinoise in 1967, burgeoning world of the Maoist and other far-left groups which were to burst on the scene dramatically a year later: May

There were, however, sharp divisions within political who sought to inject a political content into films with a more Or less conventional narrative form which would appeal to mass audiences and those who set out to find alternative forms to express audience appeal. In the former category belonged Gillo Pontecorvo who followed up the success of The Battle of Brando; and Marin Karmitz with the militant Camarades films ofthe late 1960s both explored film language (Le Gai (most notably British Sounds; 1969)

In the heady political climate of May 1968, a number of French film-makers-directors, technicians, and others formed themselves into the Estates Generalofthe Cinema and put forward various sets of proposals, all somewhat utopian, for the democratic restructuring of the French cinema The restoration of order by the government of President De Gaulle put a end to this grand design, but there was brief flowering of political film-making and the movementin France influenced independent filmmakers throughout Europe and encouraged the building of networks for the showing of political films to radin some way caught up in 1968 and its aftermath Even the generally apolitical Chabrol took part in the Estates General and later explored the world of the 'groupuscules' in Nada (1974). rapid May

attacks on mainstream cinema ('Hollywood-Mosfilm') picked up on ideas which had their origin not in Europe but in Latin America, where the Cuban film-maker Julio García Espinosa had put forward the notion of 'imperfect cinema in 1966 and the Argentinians Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino had issued their manifesto 'Towards a Third Cinema in 1969. In the long run, it was Solanas and Getino's idea of a Third Cinema equally opposed to Hollywood and to European art cinema (and its offshoots elsewhere) that proved the most influential\_ By the mid1970s most European film-makers who were in a position making of feature films, inflected to varying degrees by the political and aesthetic radicalism of the late 1960s. But the idea of Third Cinema has continued to reverberate after the heady period of particular inspiration to Third World film-makers and the black diaspora in Europe and North America. long

## THE INTERNATIONAL FILM

The runaway popular success of Last Tango in Paris in 1972 drew attention to the cinema that had been place since the 1950s. Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, with cast including Last Tango was an Italian-French co-production for United Artists release. This was by no means the first time that a European film by an artcinema' director had crossed the the Italian producer Carlo Ponti had reached agreement with MGM for a series ofthree films directed by Antonioni, which began with Blowup (1966) and Zabriskie Point (1969) and was to be completed with The Passenger (1975). And there had been the dubious experience of Visconti's The Leopard in 1962, with an international cast (Burt Lancaster; Alain Delon, Claudia Cardinale) but released by Fox in Britain and America only in severely cut and visually diminished version. taking again

the practice filmmakers was to make films principally for the domestic market, albeit one enlarged by the practice of co-production to include two or more countries, and then to seek wider release elsewhere. Film-makers in the smaller European countries were at since they needed partners from at least one of the larger viable. The Belgian director André Delvaux, for example, made most of his films from Un soir; un train in 1968 as Franco-Belgian co-productions, with Germany as third partner for Rendezvous à (1971) Other directors were less fortunate: with only a minuscule (and not necessarily sympathetic) home market behind them, were Crucially dependent on festivals and art-market distributors abroad.

But even here price has to be in the form of an insipid midAtlanticism and the marketing of Britain and Europe generally as site of 'heritage' The values of Art, which the New Wave seemed to have dismissed , have returned with vengeance, and for American audiences European art cinema is once identifed with films like Ismail Merchant and James Ivory's 1987 adaptation of E.

Films made for mainly European audiences have also suffered from a certain degree of homogenization and the of a generically European subject-matter. There is, however; no such as generic European audience on which such films can rely; and the most successful 'heritage' films tend to be those which retain degree of national specificity; to be experienced either as agreeably familiar Or as charmingly exotic. While in the 1970s many films were the recent past (Fascism, colonialism, the Second World War) the tendency in the 1980s has been to turn to a past cut off the present remoteness is accentuated by recourse to nineteenthand early twentieth-century   literary which imposes on the film the secondary filter of 'classic' art\_ Only occasionally tation of Virginia Woolfs Orlando (1992), does the past erupt creatively into the present. faking thing from

In these circumstances the nationality of a film now has less and less importance; except as a matter of locacal colour. Small countries still produce occasional successes, such as Gabriel Denmark 1987), Bille August's Pelle the Conqueror (Pelle ero breren, Sweden[Denmark, 1987),or Aki Kaurismäki's I Hired Contract Killer (FinlandJSweden, 1990).

ticularly interesting because his work stands in a oppositional relationship to conventional art cinema rather as the French New Wave did to the 'quality tradition' in the 1960s. It is in fact arguable that there are now two forms of international art cinema. On the one hand there is the official kind, very close to the mainstream both in its cinematic values and in its distribution. Under this head one would need to include notjust European art films but films such as those from the Chinese 'fifth-generation film-makers such as Zhaug Yimou and Chen Kaige which receive international acclaim for their artistic qualities And on the other hand there are low-budget independent films coming from variety of countries, including the United States, which offer a different sort of experience Film-makers such as Jim Jarmusch (Mystery Train, 1989) or David Lynch (Blue Velvet, 1986) at least as much claim to belong in this category as do their European counterparts such as Wenders or Kaurismäki.

The period falls naturally into three broad phases, each beginning with Wave; 1968; and the arrival of the Socialist government in 1981 May

## INDUSTRIAL STRUCTURES

Several mechanisms helped to in the New Wave which took the industry by surprise in 1959 (the term had been coined year earlier by Françoise Giroud in the weekly LExpress) . The political context was favourable: the newly installed Gaullist regime, keen to promote a home grown industry to counter what it saw as the cultural menace of Hollywood and its large slice of boxoffice revenues, introduced the avance sur recettes system. This film subsidy, funded by a on ticket sales and repayable by percentage of the enabled many unknowns to their first directing chance. That chance was eagerlyseized on by a groupof dynamic critics centred on the magazine Cahiers du cinéma, who carried many other new directors in their wake. Technical develop ments such as faster film stock and lighter cameras and sound recording equipment facilitated thelocation shootimprovisation, and experimentation that were the hallmark of the New Wave directors Another factor was the attitude of producers: the box office success of And God Created Woman (Et Dieu créa la femme, 1956) directed by 28-year old Roger Vadim, had helped convince them ofthe bring levy get ing'

In the aftermath of the 1968 'events the prO duction   system avance recettes subsidy was reformed so that not only producers but directors could apply for it; membership of the eligicommittee was broadened to include industry rep resentatives and prominent cultural figures instead of directors , and exhibitors got tax-breaks if showed 'quality' French films May bility they

Sofica money went to about a third of all films produced in 1991. Television was encouras and by the beginning of the 1990s the film branch of the television channel Canal Plus was investing more in the film industry even than the CNC. new tax-break aid system was introduced for films with budgets over FFSOm . and the number of expensive films being made increased.

## THE NEW WAVE

Although the traditional genres of French cinema-policiers, comedies, social dramas, costume filmsetc.continued to thrive throughout the period, and have held up on the whole much better than their equivalents in other European cinemas, the most striking development in French cinema has been the proliferation of auteur films, particularly in the years of the Wave New

The New Wave; spearheaded by the outspoken François reaction against the mainstream 'quality tradition' of the 1950s, condemned for The first two Cahiers critics to attract media attention and the New Wave when their first features were released early in 1959 were Claude Chabrol, with Le Beau Serge ('Handsome Serge' 1958) and Les Cousins (The Cousins, 1959), and Truffaut himself; with Les Quatre cents coups (The 400 Blows, 1959) were followed by fellow Cahiers critics-Eric Robmer with Le Signe du lion The sign of the 'Paris belongs to us' 1960) Jacques Doniol-Valcroze with [Eau à la bouche (À game for six lovers 1959), and Jean-Luc Godard Cahiers directors had in common a casual approach to the 'rules' of mainstream cinema, freer editing style; and 1960 Resnais's Hiroshíma; mon amour (1959), and the term 'New being off They

Subsequently he explored quasi-autobiographical vein with the mirroring Truffaut) and tried his hand at several genres , the policier to literary adaptation and period re Detached understatement (often with musical counterpoint by the versatile composer Georges Delerue)   emerged as his   preferred way emotion (Deux Anglaises et le contínent (Anne and Muriel) , 1971), passion (Le Dernier Métro (The Last Metro) , 1979), and even obsession (La Chambre verte ('The green room') , 1978).

directly, director and film, reality and fiction.

Jacques Rivette, by contrast, proved the least prolific of the Cahiers group. Very long and largely experimental, his films mix fiction and documentary; rely on improvisation, and explore the relationship between director and actor or artist and model, inviting us, as does Godard, to reflect on flm as a system ofsigns rather than a narrative process. altogether too daunting for mass audiences, and even for the distributors , he scored modest success with Céline et Julie vont en bateau (Céline and Julie go Boating, 1974) and a definitive one with La Belle Noiseuse (1990), a study of painter's obsession with his modellmuse, released in both twohour and four-hour-long version\_

Claude Chabrol was by far the most prolific of the New cinema, with succession of skilful films many in the psychological   thriller genre\_ Leavened with flashes of acidic wit, Chabrol's genre films reflect his cynical disgust with the petty bourgeoisie (La Femme infidèle (Unfaithful Wife) . 1968; Les Noces rouges (Red Wedding) 1972) and a rather jaundiced view of women, whether as schemers (Violette Nozière, 1977) or victims (Le Boucher (The Butcher) 1969).

Most of his films are grouped together in first person narrator; including his first success, Ma nuit chez Maud ('My night seasonal tales. His films build up detailed depictions of specific environments, particularly the suburban spaces of the modern although he has made a few period pieces, notably a brilliant adaptation Kleist, Die Marquise  von 0 (1976). While often dominated by conversation, his films remain eminently cinematic. they from

The predominance of former Cahiers critics among the New Wave directors has tended to obscure the role played by that magazine's inveterate rival, Positif. The latter's militancy and anticlerical stance contrasted with the avowedly apolitical but in fact right-ofcentre sympathies of the be as scathing in their use as Truffaut (particularly when attacking Godard or when referring to the montage of Robert Bresson's Le Procès de Jeanne dArc as 'a kind of spastic ping-pong') could also muster Cavalier; Claude Sautet, and Maurice Pialat, whom Cahiers they

Cofounder of the Cinémathèque Française with Henri Langlois in 1937,Georges Franju had made several remarkable documentaries before directing his first feature La Tête contre les murs (1959), at the age of 46 He made handful of other features in the 1960s and early 1970s, including Judex (1963), a tribute to Louis Feuillade.

What his films have in common is an extreme formal rigour in self-avowed attempt to explore the filmmaker's, and the spectator's, unconscious

Agnès Varda had divided her directing activities between some highly individual documentaries, and features: Cléo de 5 à 7 (1961), shot in real time7 and the tragic Sans toit ni loi (Vagabonde, 1985), both of which address feminist issues in a curiously oblique way: Their starkness contrasts with the glossy Le Bonheur (Happiness' 1964) the Other Doesn't, 1976).

## Alain Delon (1935- )

One of the leading men of post-war French cinema, Alain Delon'5 career has both benefited and suffered from a desire to be all to all cinemagoers; popular French 'vedette and international idol; commercial attraction and 'serious' actor; director and producer things

After serving as parachutist in IndoChina, Delon came to the cinema through his friendship with actor Jean Claude Brialy- His early career comprised of lightweight romantic comedies like Quand la femie s'en mêle Gaspard-Huit, 1958) his first of five screen pairings with Romy Schneider, to whom he was engaged and with whom he appeared on the Parisian stage in 1961 in Tis

Thedeath ofGérard Philipe in 1959 had left French cinema lacking leading man-of equal charisma and Soleil (René Clément, 1960) caught for the first time the devilish presence beneath the angelic surface as the biguity that other major directors saw and exploited , leading Delon tothe most prestigious and fruitful period of his career. This included roles in Visconti's Rocco and with the usual atrophied masculinity of Antonioni's male characters

Delon's films with Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jean Gabin emphasized continuity in the tradition of French screen fected style. These films were also instrumental in Delon's screen persona as the elegant tough guy.

way for the New Wave films, proving that a controversial and innovative low-budget film made by a young director could be successful at the box-office. Malle has always had penchant for taboo subjects, going on to cover issues from incest, in Le souffle au cœur (Murmur of the heart' , 1971), to child prostitution, in his first American flm, Pretty Baby (1978). He also broached the silence around French collaboration with the Nazis during the war; the period as the background for film that showed collaborators as human beings, Lacombe Lucien (1974). Malle also made exuberant comedies (Zazie dans le métro, 1960), and fictionalized examination of the Bardot myth, with Bardot as herself (Vie privée, 1961) using

Among the directors who had more substantial careers , Jacques Demy and Alain Cavalier were perhaps the most original. Demy's admiration for Max Ophuls shows in his attention to set design and the musicality of his miseen-scène: his début feature, Lola (1961), was dedicated to Ophuls. In Les Parapluies de Cherbourg (The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, 1964) and Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (The Young Girls of Rochefort; 1967), music takes over completely; both are musicals in which not only the numbers but the dialogue The other quality of his very coherent world, a kind of nostalgic melancholy; shows through in Three seats for the 26th' , 1988) in which the actor-singer Yves Montand plays

Cavalier's uneven career began with two powerful films set against the then unfashionable backdrop of the AlWar, Le Combat dans Vîle ('Combat on the island' , 1961), and LInsoumis ('The absentee' , 1964), which were notable for their economical, almost elliptical, use ofcine matic language and subtle suggestion of character. After several standard assignments, he demonstrated the same qualities again in Martin et Léa (1978), Un étrange voyage (1980), and the hieratic Thérèse (1986). gerian

The strength of French film culture in these years was demonstrated by the involvement of famous contemporary novelists, not only as script-writers but as directors as well. Alain Robbe Grillet; exponent of the nouveau roman and scriptwriter of Last Year in Marienbad, turned to direction with LImmortelle (1962), whose ratherstilted eroticism With La Musica (1966), Marguerite Duras, the novelist who had scripted Hiroshima mon amour, began cinematic œuvre distinguished by its modernity and exper-

mentation; in particular with sound. Her frequent use of non-naturalistic, repetitive voice over perhaps reflects her declared belief in the superiority of the novel over the cinema as a medium\_

## TOWARDS THE MAINSTREAM?

Jean-Pierre Mocky; a prolific but erratic director, began his career in the late 1950s, and was at his best indulging his taste for caustic and often coarse satire, directed at education system (La Grande Frousse, 1964), and television Bourvil-to the bourgeoisie (Snobs, 1961) and football sup porters (À was another prolific director who started directing features around the same time He had begun as an assistant to Truffaut and Chabrol, but for his own features he moved away from the influence of the New Wave and specialized in light and amiable comedies; often with fast-moving action and a dash of exoticism. He achieved international success with Homme de Rio (The man from Rio' , 1964), written by his preferred scriptwriter Daniel Boulanger and starring Jean-Paul Belmondo, but his inspiration, like Mocky's, seemed to flag in the 1970s and 1980s.

Other directors were able to explore personal visions within the action genre. Pierre Schoendoerffer   vividly recreated his experience of war in Vietnam in La 317ème Section (1964) and Dien Bien Phu (1992). Colonial France was also thesubject of his Le Crabe-Tambour (1976) and LHonneur similar vein with Classe tous risques ('All risks' , 1959) and one ofthe most sensitive directors working in mainstream Un cœur en hiver (1991), focus on couples andlor groups of friends, their with a deceptive simplicity in the tradition of Jacques Becker: Costa-Gavras made a spectacular début with a policier, Com partiment tueurs (1964), before successfully specializing in

succession of stylish marivaudages scripted by Nina Companeez-frothy; largely verbal comedies centred on young women's love lives; including Adorable Menteuse (Adorable liar' , 1962) and LOurs et la poupée later; equally polished films he broadened his palette with policiers (Le Dossier 51, 1978) and social comedies (La Lectrice, 1987). In 1962, director-actor Pierre Étaix was revealed as the most original new comic talent to emerge since Tati (with whom he had worked) His films (particularly Le Soupirant The suitor' 1962) Yoyo (1964), and Tant qu'on 0 la santé (As long as health lasts' 1965)) are burlesque in their own right, while referring constantly to American silent comedies of the 1920s (especially Keaton) He has since worked mainly in the circus

Several other   prolific directors   working in popular genres   began their careers during the post-New Wave period. Gérard Oury   specialized in rather unsubtle comedy; and made the two biggest post-war hits to that date, Le Corniaud (1964) and La Grande Vadrouille (1966), both starring Bourvil and Louis de Funès. This was the genre also favoured by Édouard Molinaro; director of Oscar (1966) Hibernatus (1968) both with de Funès-and La aux folles (1978). Actor-director Yves Robert made a series several of them huge boxoffice successes (La which hecombined, through deceptively skilful direction, hilarious comedy with genuine affection for his characThe policier genre was exploited by several directors, notably Jacques Deray (Borsalino; 1970) and Pierre GranierDeferre (Une étrange affaire, 1981).

Many directors both inside and outside the mainstream of the New Wave continued to make worthwhile flms in the 1960s and 1970s. They included some who found favour with the Cahiers critics. Robert Bresson occupies a unique place, neither with the established mainstream cinema nor attached to the New Wave He pursued his relentless exploration of the theme of redemption in his increasingly idiosyncratic compelling manner (flat, conventional story-line, unrealistic dialogue emphasized by the use of non-professional actors) in Le Procès de Jeanne dArc ('The trial of Joan of Arc' 1961) Au hasard Balthazar (1965), Mouchette (1966), Une femme douce (1968) and Le Diable probablement (1976). yet

Jean Renoir was still active during this period, but he turned increasingly towards television and book-writing He did look back on the world of La Grande Illusion in Le Caporal épinglé (The Vanishing Corporal,   1961). Jean-Pierre Melville continued to affirm his auteur status within single the policier, creating dark and pre dominantly male universe with a strong and almost ritualistic flavour of the American film noir he so loved (Le Deuxième Souffle, 1966; Le Samouraï, 1967; and Un flic, 1972) Other well-established   pre-New Wave directors con-

Of the directors of the old guard sneered at by Cahiers , some (Jean Delannoy, Henri Decoin, Julien Duvivier, and Marcel Carné) made only of them unremarkable. Despite ever-increasing financial difficulties, Jacques Tati continued to satirize modern civilization through his alter ego Monsieur Hulot. In Playtime (1961) and Trafic (1969) his meticulously thought-out gags are can be extraordinarily subtle, sometimes to the of being almost imperceptible point

## MAY 1968 AND AFTER

The 1968 'events affected not just production structure but film content. With filmmakers themselves having greater say in the attribution of the avance- surrecettes from 1969 on, wider  spectrum of directors (including many women) got a chance to make their first focused on the 'events' themselves and their repercussions were made: Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin's Tout va bien (1971), Marin Karmitz's pour coup (1971), and René Vautier and Nicole Le Garrec's Quand tu disais Valéry (1975). René Allio, who had already directed touching comedy about merry widow La Vieille  Dame indigne (1964), looked at history through the prism of 1968 in Les centrating on more specifically regional issues in Retour à Marseille (1978) May Coup May

The way May 1968 affected social attitudes can be sensed most directly in two films by auteur directors, Jean Eustache's La Maman et la putain 'The mother and the whore' , 1972) and Jacques Doillon's Les Doigts dans la tête (1974), both of which explore personal relationships in a searingly intense way. Doillon went on to make a series of Like Doillon; Maurice Pialat sometimes appears in his own films, often relies on improvisation; and demands considerable commitment from his actors

considerable personality: Jean-Jacques Beineix, Luc Besson, and Leos Their cinema, sometimes described as post-modern; orthe 'cinema du look' (roughly speaking the image is the message) had greater success (1979), and La Lune dans le caniveau (The Moon in the Gutter; au matin (Betty Blue, 1985), launched the career of Béatrice Dalle and gained cult

Emotional violence is never far below the surface of Pialat's films, coming across more convincingly in his which centres on the problems of young people (Passe ton bac d'abord, 1976) or the couple (Loulou; 1979). A similar 'intimist' favour pervades the uneven if Hôtel des Amériques; 1981; Ma saison préférée , 1993; and the acclaimed Les Roseaux sauvages, 1994)

Yves Boisset and Bertrand Tavernier; both former film critics whose love of American cinema and culture is reflected in their directing styles, excel at denouncing political and abuses in the best radical humanist tradition. When he has a script, Boisset is as at understatement in his moving portraits of a woman cop at hyperbole when lambasting racism (Dupont Lajoie, 1975) OI the abuses of television (Le Prix 1979). Although sometimes verging on the gently sentimental, Tavernier is a sinewy director whose meticulous attention to psychological and historical detail serves him well. He has tackled a very wide range of subjects: the world of Simenon (LHorloger de Saint-Paul, 1973), death (La Vie et rien d'autre, 1988), the police (L.627,1991), and various episodes from French history, from the Middle Ages (La Passion Béatrice, 1986) and the Régence (Que la fête commence, 1974), to life in Coup de torchon, 1981) police good good

Whereas Tavernier could be said to have turned his back on the New Wave ethos (he has more than once used the services of Truffaut's bête noire, veteran script-writer Jean Aurenche) , Bertrand Blier's misogyny, rejection ofrealism fetishistic use of actors, and love of paradox-though not his sense of humour-are strongly reminiscent of Godard Delon plays a drunken cuckold in Notre histoire (1983), and Gérard Depardieu homosexual in Tenue de soirée (1985) and husband who falls in love with a less attractive woman than his wife in of Blier's films including Les Valseuses (1973), which shot Depardieu to stardom, are adaptations of his own novels; hence the coherence of his comic-absurd universe Trop

The 1980s also saw the emergence of a new phenomlives of young, second-generation North Africans 'beur' is back-slang for 'Arabe'). Consisting of both popular mainstream  features and low-budget mm. films shown outside normal distribution channels, beur films eschew the subject of racism and instead employ a mix of genres , including comedy; to draw a naturalistic picture of life in the working-class suburbs of Paris . Although there have been relatively few beur films made, the best, such as Mehdi Charef's Le Thé au harem d'Archimède (1986) and Rachid Bouchareb's Cheb (1990), had great impact, due to their originality and their success in bringing new section of French society realistically on to film. have

A major feature of the period since the mid-1970s has been the emergence of an increasing number of women directors. Up to this point Varda and Duras had been virtually on their own. The phenomenon can be explained by the rise of the women's movement since 1968, and the fact that the avance sur recettes system now supports independent film-makers. Women directors often addressed feminist concerns, but, with the ebb of feminism in France from the late 1970s on, have mostly worked in isolation and shunned the notion of a structured Nelly Kaplan, who had been Abel Gance's assistant in the 1950s, started the feminist breakthrough with her corrosive La Fiancée du pirate (UK: The Pirate's Fiancee; US: Dirty 1969),a film about an abused woman who control over village by becoming d'amour, 1990),it cleverly uses surrealist humour to deflate the male ego. Yannick Bellon, who, after a distinguished career as maker of shorts, directed her first feature in 1972 at the age of 48, has tackled social issues in LAmour nu (1981) La Triche (1983), and Les Enfants du désordre (1988).

In addition to Balasko, they included Depardieu; Miou-Miou, Thierry Lhermitte, Coluche, Patrick Dewaere, Michel Blanc, Dominique Lavanant; Gérard Jugnot, and Christian Clavier. All of them (apart from the late Dewaere and Coluche) continue to make dynamic contribution to French cinema, and Depardieu has become an international star: May

The 1960-93 period in generalwas notable for its wealth ofacting talent.In the 1960s, already established stars like Fernandel and Jean Marais   pursued their careers cessfully, but the biggest crowd-pullers were the knockabout comedians de Funès and Bourvil.

## Italy: Auteurs and After

The year 1960 was remarkable one for Italian cinema\_ For the first (and only) time since 1946 Italian films not only overtook Hollywood films in popularity in the domestic market but captured over 50 per cent of total boxoffice. Three films released that year-Luchino Visconti's La dolce vita ('The life' ), and Michelangelo Antonioni's Lavventura The adventure')also went on to be major successes abroad. good

there is no doubt that 1960 was the watershed , ushering in a period of generalized renewal of modes of expression in the cinema. While Rocco (and another great box-office success of that year, Luigi Comencini's Tutti casa ('Everybody go home' )), might be seen as throwbacks to earlier modes , and La dolce vita definitively turned their backs on the past and prefigured the surge of developments to come\_

The triumphs of 1960 had been prefigured in 1959, Italian films-Roberto Rossellini's Il Generale   Della Rovere and Mario Monicelli's La grande guerra ('The Great

## NEW DIRECTORS OF THE 19605 AND 19705

The years 1961 and 1962 saw a remarkable series of first films new directors, which can only be compared to the explosion of the French 'Nouvelle Vague preceded it: Pasolini's Accattone, Vittorio De Seta's Banditi Orgosolo ('Bandits of Orgosolo'), Ermanno Olmi's Il posto from 1961 La commare secca ('The reaper by Bernardo Bertolucci and Un uomo da bruciare ('Aman for the killing') by the Taviani brothers and Valentino Orsini, both in 1962; not to mention films by Tinto Brass , Ugo Gregoretti, Giuliano Montaldo, Alfredo Giannetti, and others, all in 1962 from grim

The two most heterodox film-makers of this generation were Pier Paolo Pasolini and Marco Ferreri. For Pasolini, cinema was the continuation of literary and political need for selfpromotion, combined with fierce will to death near the beach at Ostia only served to reaffirm. His: cinema began in style of spirited dilettantism; which contrasted strikingly with the traditional conventions of La ricotta ('Curd-cheese' 1962), The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964), and Uccellacci e uccellini The hawks and the sparrows' , 1966) have an iconoclastic freshness which his later work never recaptured

In a survey of twenty Italian critics for the 'Premio Bolaffi' , awarded to the best film of the decade 1966-75 the winner was Dillinger è morto (' 'Dillinger is dead , 1969) by Marco Ferreri, followed by Antonioni's Blowup (1966) Uccellacci e uccellini, and La Grande Bouffe (La grande abbuffata, 1973), also by Ferreri. anthrope, Ferreri, known as the 'Spanish Milanese' , undertook in collaboration with the Spanish writer Rafael Azcona asustained analysis of relations between the sexes \_ founded on a mixture of cruelty and suffering, ridicule and emotion; sarcasm and a sense of tragedy; with a taste for the repulsive and the abnormal which derived from an aspect of the Spanish temperament and culture which formed him.

His career began (The queen bee 1963), and he went on to make number of films whose titles alone are sufficient to give explored in them-La donna scimmia ('The ape-woman' , 1964), Lharem ('The harem'. 1967), La cagna Dillinger è morto, a nocturnal 'happening' about alienation and the ('Man's seed' , 1969) an apocalyptic fable of the end of the last

With The Níght of the Shooting Stars (La notte di San Lorenzo, 1982), on the 1943 through the eyes of child, ideological commitment gave way to the joy of story-telling and of the recall of our earliest feelings, and this tone continued somewhat unevenly; in by Pirandello's short stories, and in Good Morning Babylon (1987), the saga of two Italian emigrants who end up working in D.

The critical and surprise popular success of Olmi's Tree (L'albero degli zoccoli, 1978), a solemn and harmonious poem on the memory of peasant ways , work in the fields, its joys and hardships, crowned a career of admirable artistic and stylistically rigorous and of a refined clarity even in his only literary adaptation and only highbudget film, The Legend of the Holy Drinker (La leggenda del santo bevitore, 1988), Olmi tells the ordinary stories of ordinary people in their ordinary but never-before narrated , worlds. Over the years, he has toned down his poetic vein and turned an ever-harsher critical gaze on his subjects, as in Camminacammina ('On and Men, and in the harsh documentary Milano '83.

Vittorio De Seta can be related to Olmi through the solitary and marginal nature of his work, and through his origin as a documentarist. He is almost unknown outside His first film Banditi a Orgosolo (1961) was a dramatic and lyrical tale on the backwardness of Sardinia, and won him

critical acclaim, but his next film, Un uomo a metà ('Half a man 1966}, a Jungian story of neurosis, had a more mixed reception. His most important film was Diario di un maestro 1973), a TV mini-series in four episodes in which the neorealist ethic was filtered through the techniques oflive filming It was also the only film to follow up the issues raised by Don Lorenzo Milani's controversial and innovatory book on schooling, Letter to Teacher, published five years earlier:

With films like Estate violenta ('Violent summer' 1959) and La ragazza con la valigia ('The girl with the suitcase' , 1960), Zurlini achieved reputation as one of Italian cinema's few love poets, but apart from Cronaca familiare (Family chronicle') which shared the Lion at Venice with Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood in 1962, his work is little known abroad.

A historian of the twenty-first century could well trace through the development of film comedy a sort of anthropological-cum-cultural history of the period 1960-79.However; two factors detract from the representative value of the comedy genre in those years: importance for the ideology and structure of these films) were all themselves products of values which provided

The five dominant personalities and showmen 'mattatori in this field for twenty-five years were: Alberto Sordi, whose screen character was an idle opportunist, hypocritical Catholic and 'mamma's boy' ; Nino Manfredi , whose humour was patient and slow; Vittorio Gassman, with his particular taste for excess; Ugo Tognazzi the most flexible of the five (and the only one to offer his services to an auteur-director, Ferreri); and, set apart somewhat, Marcello Mastroianni, the most accessible and malleable, and the only one not to be imprisoned in the comedy genre, and to achieve real international fame

## POLITICAL CINEMA

Ever since 1945, Italy has had a long and intense tradition of political cinema. In the 1950s, this was borne out by the notable success of the Don Camillo series, from the books by Giovanni Guareschi, (played by the French actor Fernandel) and his rival Peppone (Gino Cervi) embodied the Catholic-Communist feud in their rural, backward community. For convenience, political cinema after 1960 can be divided into four categories hero

From La sfida (The challenge' 1959) to Dimenticare Palermo ('Forget Palermo' , 1990) and Diario napoletano ('Neapolitan diary' 1992), with their passionate involvement with the south, and their robust story-lines, Francesco Rosi's work was thestandard-bearer in this area Sicily, as a land of and of Mafia, has also been treated by Germi, Lattuada (Mafioso; 1962) Pasquale Squi-

There were also cycles of derivative genres of all kinds such as spy films, cop films, erotic-pornographic films, and macabre mystery films, each trying to cash in on the latest fad, but with only ephemeral results

Around the same time Riccardo Freda; with I vampiri ('The vampires' , 1956), and Mario Bava, with La maschera del demonio ('The mask of the demon' , 1960), set in motion a new genre of Italian horror cinema, which was to enjoy remarkable growth in the following two decades. In Dario Argento the horror film found its most savage practitioner. His delirious formalistic excess made him a cult public and for many of the younger generation of critics.

Three genres, however; enjoyed degree of longevity and commercial and even critical success. Heir to a tradition stretching back to Cabiria (1914), the so-called 'historical-mythological' (or 'peplum film was inaugurated in its modern guise by Pietro Francisci's The Labours of Hercules (Le fatiche di Ercole) in 1958 and flourished until The genre featured   strong-man heroes , usually called Hercules or Maciste and often played by American actor and former Mr Universe Steve Reeves , and achieved a certain distinction, aided by a tone of wit and detachment in films like Vittorio Cottafavi's Hercules Conquers Atlantis (Ercole alla conquista di Atlantide, 1961) and lurching into cheerful selfparody in Duccio Tessari's The Titans (Arrivano Titani, 1961)

It noted general, growing, and irreversible in attendances all over Europe; but in Italy the situation was little short of catastrophic-a collapse in tickets sold 514 million in 1976 to 276 million in 1979. The following few years brought similar falls, to 165 million in 1983, 120 million in 1986, and only 90 million in 1992.

the State, or by the political class, and the rapid proliferation of private television stations whose schedules were built around the transmission of films-up to 1,500 per week. Such uncontrolled pro liferation led inexorably to the powerful monopoly of vision networks, and many others 'RAI' networks. The effect on freedom of cinematographic production was swift and serious.

In the second half of the 1970s, reflecting the general deterioration in the social and political climate of the country (terrorism, organized crime, drugs, crises of political institutions), Italian comedy underwent a profound transformation. The heritage of the old 'masters Comencini, Monicelli, Risi, Scola-was turned more towards harsh, dramatically intense, even grotesque style.

Much of the strength (and weakness) of the Italian cinema after 1945 can be traced to the entrepreneurial activities ofits producers-whether household names, like Carlo Ponti and Dino De Laurentiis, or less well known but equally important, like Riccardo Gualino at Lux and Goffredo Lombardo at Titanus: The most successful of Franco Cristaldi

## Spain After Franco

Just as the Spanish Civil War of 1936-9 has frequently been called World War, democracy can be seen as prefiguring the sudden collapse ofthe Cold War paradigm which followed in 1945.Spanish cinema played an important role in figuring Spain's move to democracy; not only after Franco's death in 1975, but a herSpain began to be opened to foreign influence and new Spanish cinema emerged on the world scene

## LOOSENING THE BONDS OF DICTATORSHIP

According to historian Stanley Payne (1987-8), Spain underwent a three-stage process ofdefascistization, which began when Franco realized that Hitler and Mussolini would lose the Second World War; was accelerated at the height of the Cold War (1945-57) when Spain began moving toward the new European resurgence was partially financed by the US Marshall Plan; and was formalized in the 1960s through a policy of aperturismo ('opening up) that was actively promoted by Franco's new Minister of Information and Tourism, Manuel Fraga Iribarne. This drive toward liberalization contained double irony. First, despite its overtures to foreign investors the Francoist regime continued to impose a mono lithic culture at home. This contradiction provided a focal point for film-makers who wanted to create cinema of

opposition that could project a different image of Spain both at home and abroad\_ when their films won prestigious awards at international festivals, demonstrating that a modernized Spain was now capable of generating (and tolerating) an articulate oppo sitional culture

These contradictions were dramatized in Bienvenido; Mr Marshall! ('Welcome Mr Marshalll' , 1952), which was Festival. This clever satire (co-written by Luis Berlanga and Juan Antonio Bardem) shows inhabitants of a small Castilian village competing with other Spaniards for their share of the Marshall Plan by dressing up as gypsies and matadors , complete with fake movie sets. This illusion evokes the españolada; popular   genre that promoted regional images of an exotic Andalusia as a cultural stereotype for so called 'national' cinema-a fictional unity imposed at home at the cost of cultural and regional difference in order to be successfully promoted abroad as national commodity: The villagers do have 'real needs, the kind that depicted in Italian neo realist films; turn to Hollywood fantasies which get them only deeper in debt. In series of humorous dreams, we see how refigure their needs through movie images they have internalized . The mayor dreams he is sheriff in a saloon doing what cowboys being yet they foreign

typically do in Hollywood Westerns, but when the saloon's star singer reverts back to the españolada, he is left clinging to the old stereotype. A peasant dreams of a tractor being dropped from heaven by a plane. Although both vehicles carry a USA label, the style in which are represented clearly comes from Soviet Socialist Realism. The film demonstrates how foreign conventions can be reinscribed through hybridization to a new filmic language that is capableof challenging the monolithic Francoist culture. they forge

Hollywood melodrama-its editing syntax; its strategies of binding the spectator to the text, its glossy surface; and its emphasis on glamorous close-ups to privilege the star. Yet it exaggerates these conventions to expose their ideological implications, especially their privileging of the bourgeoisie. sequences whose deep-focus shots reduce the size of the protagonist and reposition him within a broader context of class conflict. long

The opposition's critique of Francoist cinema was formalized in 1955 at four-day national congress in the university town of Salamanca. Like the meetings in Oberhausen that led to the Young German Cinema of the 1960s, these 'Salamanca Conversaciones' generated harsh diatribe against the current state of cinema: 'After 60 years of films, Spanish cinema is politically ineffective socially false, intellectually worthless, aesthetically nonexistent, and industrially crippled: Although written by Bardem (a member of the Spanish Communist Party), this judgement was widely shared by participants at the conGarcía Escudero, the government's former undersecretary for cinema\_ Escudero had been forced to resign in 1952 for having denied the national interest' category to Alba de América (1951), a big-budget historical drama personally realist film Surcos ('Furrows' , 1951), which was directed by former Falangist José Nieves Conde.

right looked to Italian neo-realism as in opposition to Hollywood conventions and using this dialectic to structure many of the films of the period. In 1971 this dialectic was evoked by Basilio Martín Patino (one of the organizers of the Salamanca congress) in his para después de una guerra for after a war' ). Patino includes a resonant image from De Sica's Bicycle Thieves, one of the neo-realist films shown in Madrid in 1951 during an Italian film week that deeply infuenced Bardem and Berlanga. It shows the working class protagonist hanging a movie poster glamorous image that distracts both him and the spectator away from the street where his bicycle is soon to be stolen. This image was emblematic of the choice Spanish film-makers in the 1950s: whether to emulate the neo-realist documentation of pressing socio economic problems or to follow Hollywood's escape into spectacle, melodrama, and stardom key Songs facing

The film-maker who pushed hardest against the official censorship in the 1960s was Basque-born producer Elías Querejeta, who assembled collaborative team which created a distinctive style of indirection that could subtly address political issues. His team included the brilliant cinematographer Luis Cuadrado; who was known for cultivating the 'blackness' of the great seventeenth century Spanish masters like Murillo, Ribera, Zurbarán, and Velázquez; editor Pablo G.

Although the hunt is a common trope in many cultures for narrativizing had special meaning in Spain, where it was favourite pastime for Franco his cohorts.

The film implies that the children of Franco would turn out to be the children of Frankenstein-precocious emotionally stunted by historical traumas that could still not be   directly   represented on screen.

A different approach to reinscription was pursued by director-producer José Luis Borau in Furtivos ('Poachers 1975), which he co-wrote with Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón.

When the flm was finally released in 1981, like Furtivos it broke Spanish box office records. By 1983 she realized that few Spanish introduced a new law that protected Spanish films against foreign imports and substantially increased government subsidy. Yet Spanish film production continued to plummet (reaching a new all-time low of forty-seven films in 1989); the only increases were in production costs and government expenditures. Miró's critics attacked her for encouraging 'self-indulgent' artists to ignore the realities of the market-place and the changing tastes of Spanish audiences-

When Law of Desire (La ley del deseo, 1986) received critical raves at the 1987 Berlin festival and did well commercially in foreign markets, the Socialist government used it to promote Spain's culture industry-a strategy that was similar to Franco's earlier use of oppositional figures like Saura and Querejeta. Despite the film's homoerotic sex scenes and its backstory ofhomosexual incest; Fotogramas y video (Spain's oldest and largest circulation film journal) heralded it as model for Spain's cinema of the future, one that could arouse interest abroad not only at the level of cultural curiosity as an exportable and commercially valid product' . Yet Almodóvar's success was based on risk-taking. By watching his erotic cinematic hybrids, spectators risk having their own future refigured and their sexuality destabilized and reinscribed, which is precisely what happens to the Antonio Banderas character after watching the inset homoerotic porn at the opening of Law of Desire Almodóvar soon succeeded in establishan outrageous   protean sexuality (in place of the españolada) as the new cultural stereotype for a superliberated post-Franco Spain. Thus he subverted the centre sion helped to demarginalize Spanish cinema in the world all-time thirteen exports to the USA were directed by Almodóvar. but ing top

This global success was to become even more crucial in the 1990s as Spain moved toward convergence with other members ofthe European Community In contrast to 1983, when González was eager to demonstrate Spain's ideo logical transformation and therefore supported the Miró decree; in 1992 he was more interested in demonstrating fiscal responsibility to his European peers so that Spain could meet the economic criteria established at Maastricht in December 1991. Given the increasing pressure to stop subsidizing industries that were losing money, the was whether the film and television industries should be exempt since manufacture unique cultural products that construct images of national identity for world consumption they

In June 1992 Spanish film-makers held a three-day conference in Madrid called Participants urged the government to pass new law to protect Spanish cinema from Hollywood domination and the 'Euro-pudding' co-productions of the EC that threatened to erase the cultural specificity of Spain and its autonomous regions. Like the Salamanca congress, it ended with dire pronouncement, this time by conference   president Román who warned that, without government protection, 'in 1995, instead of celethe centennial of Spanish cinema, from brating

Despite Gubern's dire prophecy in the early 1990s Spain has already had three major triumphs in the North American market that were not directed by Almodóvar, even though he helped pave the way for their success: Vicente 1990), Bigas Luna's Jamón Jamón ('Ham, ham' , 1991), and Fernando Trueba's Belle Époque (1992). All three were directed by film-makers who are super-liberated Spain with the oppositional culture of an dramatic excess , tradition that can be traced back to Buñuels surrealistic classic Un chien andalou in the 1920s and was mainstreamed by Almodóvar in the 1980s. While remaining within predominantly heterosexual discourse, all three are driven by female desire.

Jamón Jamón seems to question whether the effects of Spain's historic shift to democracy and post-modern consumerism is really as liberating as advertised\_ The sub stitution of erotic images for the Andalusian stereotype is overseen by a businessman played by Juan Diego, the actor who first represented Franco on screen in fictional film UJaime Camino's Dragón Rapide, 1986). In the opening shot we see a desolate Spanish plain through the silhouette of one of those gigantic black bulls advertising Osborn ticles which are cracked and creaking. This traditional sign of Spanish machismo is later rivalled by an equally giant post-Franco billboard with a crotch shot of Samsonbrand briefs , which Manuels  family firm has manufactured for three generations .

The history of British cinema has always been at best an uneven one, marked by cycles of confidence and expansion followed by decline and stagnation The period from 1960 saw similar fluctuations but with one crucial difference: by the early 1990s it was possible to argue that the British structure producing a certain critical mass of audiovisual fictions for exhibition in cinemas, no longer existed. Films continued to be made but most were primarily for a tele vision audience, with perhaps a brief theatrical 'window' as kind of showcase, and the films that were most selfconsciously 'English' were predominantly made with American money and for the American market. This period, then, marks process of fundamental transition Or terminal decline, depending on your view of what It begins in the middle of a boom, but one which already marked a shift on the part of certain British producers to establish a degree of independence from the dominant structures of the industry Such 'independence' would achieve nificance in the 1980s, but by then the industry itself had changed irrevocably. sig

The British with its focus on contemporary out of 'Free Cinema' , movement of oppositional film-makers and critics like mitted to shaking up moribund British film culture These film-makers had produced influential documentaries in the late 1950s, such as Momma Don't Allow (Richardson, 1956), except Christmas (Anderson; 1957), and We Are the Lambeth Boys (Reisz; 1959), on subjects such as the emerging youth culture and more traditional aspects of working class life Their ambitions to graduate into features required both appropriate subjects and sources of finance\_ grew Every Day

Allied Film Makers , new independent   company formed by Bryan Forbes and Richard Attenborough, also produced several films including Whistle down the Wind (Forbes, 1961) and L-Shaped Room (Forbes, 1964), a rare example in the genre of a contemporary subject featuring young woman's experiences in London's bedsit land Outside the aegis of Woodfall and British Lion other notable contributors to the British New Wave' included John Schlesinger; another former documentarist; who directed A Kind of Loving (1962) and Billy Liar (1963) The latter shared the working-class, urban milieu of the genre, but deflected its characteristic anger and desperation into comedy; centred around an undertaker's clerk who lives in a world of fantasy.

Lindsay Anderson contributed the raw and brutal This Sporting Life (1963), adapted by David Storey from his own novel. However; Richardson continued to be the most prolific of the group; collabora with Shelagh Delaney (the only woman in the 'Angry' coterie) on A Taste of Honey (1961) and with Sillitoe on The Loneliness of the Distance Runner (1962) BryLong

Collectively these films constituted the latest manifestation of progressive realist aesthetic in British cinema; dating back to Grierson's 'documentary ideal' which involved a gradual extension of the cinematic franchise to include realistic representations of the lower orders in society And while many can be criticized their overt sexism and machismo; the New Wave films did mark a certain aesthetic evolution in British cinema, from the initial largely studiobased productions of Room at the Top and Look back in Anger; to the freer cinéma-vérité style of for

These films also marked the emergence of a new breed of British actor: a tough, street-wise, and instinctive performer, whose acting style owed more to Brando and Dean than to Olivier and Guinness\_ The 'authenticity' of the likes of Albert Finney, Tom Courtenay, Rita Tushingham also helped to give the New Wave films a classconscious edge which had previously been lacking: and

The New Wave represented an extremely dynamic, but

In that year Richardson directed his first colour film: an adaptation of Fielding's eighteenth-century picaresque novel Tom Jones, with Albert Finney as the bawdy fun-loving hero.

Tom Jones was backed by United Artists, and following its success a British cinema, ensuring a buoyancy of production. This interest was on such a scale that, as Dickinson and Street (1985) put it: 'after 1961 it became increasingly difficult to define any part of the industry as British rather than At around the same time UA also financed two other films whose success heralded a new era in British cinema.A Hard Day's Night (1963), directed by the American Richard Lester;, was a semi-fictional vehicle irrepressible energy and youthful irreverence leapt offthe screen in what is clearly a feature-length prototype man (who had Woodfall in 1961) and his new partner Albert 'Cubby Broccoli secured backing from UA for modestly budgeted adaptation ofIan Fleming's thriller Dr decision to cast a relatively unknown Scottish actor, Sean Connery; as Fleming's suave English agent James Bond inaugurated one of the most commercially successful series in British cinema history. Connery repeated his role in From Russia with Love (1963), Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965), You only Live Twice (1967), and Diamonds are Forever (1971) However, by the early 1970s he was keen to develop his career in other directions and abandoned the part.

Alongside the early Bond movies other cinematic series continued to thrive.

The late 1960s boom in production also benefited several British directors who had established themselves in television and were now able to make the breakthrough into features. Amongst their number were Ken Loach; who with Garnett had been at the forefront of the most innovative social drama with single television plays like Up the Junction (1965) and Cathy Come Home (1966) His of working class childhood, filmed on location in Barnsley with partially cast. Ken Russell , graduate from the BBC television Monitor, began a career which established his reputation as the enfant terrible of British cinema.

As the hopes and promises of the decade began to look little tarnished, so elements of British cinema took on a darker edge. Social criticism returned as a popularsubject, as film took on a radical flavour backdrop of discontent, student politics, and protest against the war in Vietnam. This was most visible in Lindsay Anderson's (1968), a vitriolic attack on the British public schools and the deeply divided society which continued to underpin, and Tony Richardson's epic anti-war polemic The Charge of the Light Brigade (1968) which was as much response to Vietnam as a savage condemnation ofBritain's glorious' imperial past against they

came from America. Then almost overnight the bubble burst. Having increasingly succumbed to blockbuster mentality; the American majors found that they had overspent on a series of big-budget films, including British productions like The Battle of Britain (Guy Hamilton, 1969), Cromwell (Ken Hughes, 1970), Goodbye, Mr Chips (Herbert which all failed dismally at the boxoffice\_ Moreover, US audiences were turning towards more modest indigenous films like The Graduate (1967), Bonnie and Clyde (1967), and Rider (1969), which were providing the excitement and freshness which British films were no longer deliverThe result was that the Americans pulled out in their droves leaving the British industry bereft of a major part ofits production finance.

During the 1970s, certain corporate giants emerged to fill the gap created by this collapse. EML, which had begun life in the music industry, bought the Associated British

Capturing the lucrative American market had been the dream of British film financiers since before the days of Alexander Korda; and was a motivating factor behind Lew Grade's venture into international whose ITC company had built its international reputation on the back of popular television series, was essentially salesman and his technique was to pre-sell films around the world, using the advances and guarantees to finance production\_ He also embarked on a series of big-budget films aimed at the American market, using well-known actors and 'safe subjects   such as adaptations of bestselling novels and remakes of old classics. The results were generally bland and unpopular with audiences , culminating in the débâcle of the $35 million Raise the Titanic (1980) which like the famous liner; sank without trace, Grade with it. taking

An alternative production strategy to the corporate manœuvrings of EMI and Lew Grade was for an energetic lone producer to sell individual projects to a North American distributor. One successful exponent of this technique was David Puttnam; who during the 1970s produced Apted, 1974), and Bugsy Malone (Alan Parker; 1976). While directors like Apted and Parker subsequently joined the drain of talent to Hollywood , Puttnam was to be a leading player in the next upturn in the fortunes of the British cinema

At the forefront of the new British cinema was Goldcrest, production company headed by Canadian Jake Eberts which had provided development for Chariots and, after Eberts had raised substantial portfolio of investment;

Alongside Goldcrest, a handful of other new companies seemingly committed to dynamic concept of British cinema began to emerge. They included HandMade films, formed in 1978 by ex-Beatle George Harrison to rescue Monty Python's Life of Brian which had disowned by EMI. The company tended to concentrate on comedy comedy team: Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits (1981), a huge success which grossed $45 million in North America, Privates on Parade (1982), The Missionary (1983), and A Private Function (1984). HandMade were joined by Virgin Vision; an offshoot of Richard Branson's music empire whose productions included Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), Michael Radford's atmospheric   rendering of Orwell's classic. Palace Productions, set up by Nik Powell and Stephen Woolley; was also film distribution company and made its production début in 1984 been

The mini-'renaissance driven by Goldcrest did not last many years. In 1986 the company collapsed in the wake of the failure of an over-ambitious production roster which included three big-budget films: Absolute Beginners (Julien Mission (Roland Joffé, 1986). The first two films went substantially over budget, and none of them made the necessmore than a sales agency.

In addition to its own commissioning programme Channel 4 also made significant financial contributions to the sustenance ofBritish cinema through British Screen and the British Film Institute Production Board, helping to sustain their small but innovative film-making pro gramme. In the late 1970s the BFI changed their filmmaking   policy away from concentration on expercinematic forms, in particular narrative features. The first film to be made under the new policy was Chris Petit's Radio on (1980) and subsequent works have included The (Derek Jarman, 1986), and Distant Voices; Still Lives (Terence Davies, 1988).

At the same time, developments at the low-budget end ofthe production spectrum appeared to provide the induswith lifeline In 1982 the fourth British terrestrial television channel was launched, marking the dawn of new relationship between the cinema and television industries in Britain. The chief executive of Channel 4, Jeremy Isaacs, announced that the company would invest which could be given theatrical 'window' before being shown films only after they had been shown in cinemas and often for ridiculously low prices. Channel 4's decision proved to be the transfusion the industry required, particularly area low-budget   production; the company financed around 150 films in their first ten years \_ including My Beautiful Laundrette (Stephen Frears; 1985), A Letter to Brezhnev (Chris Bernard, 1985), Comrades (Bill Douglas, 1987), and High Hopes (Mike Leigh, 1988) try

Greenaway's lush, enigmatic images in films Belly of an Architect (1987) and Drowning by Numbers (1988) have won him many admirers. His interests are in intellectual game-playing shot through with welter of artistic and cultural references and highly stylized performances. His visual imagination is undoubtedly impressive but he has characters , which frequently renders them hollow ciphers , pawns in an elaborate game. like

Jarman's career, like so many others in British cinema\_ was an uphill struggle. Talent apparently exists but while there is makers must either remain on the underfunded margins or move to Hollywood (as did Karel Reisz, John Boorman,

Scott, Bill Forsyth, etc ). In the mid-1990s, funding remains as difficult to come byas ever. British cinema may have been saved by television, but with production levels at an alarmingly low level it is difficult to predict a future for British cinema outside extremely restricted terms of reference. Interest in the domestic product may been rekindled by the spectacular success of Four Weddings and a Funeral (Mike Newell, 1994),amodest (E3 million) romantic comedy which grossed more than $240 million worldwide But despite the temporary egoboost to British cinema weshould all be wary ofproclaiming anew 'renaissance' .

## The New German Cinema

The slow but steady rise of German post-war cinema provincial obscurity to international fame is often told as story with bold beginning (the Oberhausen Manifesto on 28 February 1962) a climax (Time calling it 'the liveliest cinema in Europe= in   1978), and an abrupt   ending (Fassbinder's death on 10 June 1982). This story also has a trajectory\_a national cinema involved in coming to terms with the blemished identity of the country it represents. Many German films of that period also react to the bled history of the medium itself as the prime Nazi propaganda tool.

## CREATING 'NEW CINEMA

The years 1961-2 were years of crisis in Germany: the Berlin Wall, erected in August 1961, seemed to cement the division of Germany into two alternative social systems (West/East; capitalistlCommunist); the Eichmann trials in Jerusalem (concluded in December 1961) threw glaring light on the unprecedented crimes committed by the Nazi regime; and Chancellor Adenauer's attempt to the freedom of the press in the so-called Spiegel Affair was met with an unexpected storm of protest. It was also a critical juncture for German cinema. The commercial film industhat during the 1950s mass-produced highly popular; profitable, and unabashedly provincial films had to cope with a sudden German cinema had lost more than three-quarters of its audience to television. While the number of television sets jumped from 700,000 to 7.2 million between 1956 and million to 180 million per year. For young film-makers in Germany the spectacular crash of the commercial cinema offered a chance and an 'incentive to experiment with alternative visions\_ began to direct their own short films , several of which were awarded prizes at international festivals. Encouraged by thesuccess ofthe British quell try They

This new film needs new freedoms Freedom the conventions of the established industry. Freedom from the outside special interest groups. We have concrete intellectual, formal, and economic conceptions about the production of the new German film. We are as a collective prepared to take economic risks from

The very claim to create a new film ex nihilo, in negation of history and tradition, recalls not only the futurist and other   avant-garde manifestos in the early part of the century; its stance of pure creation also points to a Romantic notion of authorship not bound by economics or the expectations of an audience. Furthermore, the sharp line drawn between the 'old film and the young foreclosed any productive co operation between the industry and its enthusiastic challengers. In contrast to the French New Wave that was soon integrated into the mainstream, rejuvenating it in the process, hardly an attempt was made by the established German producers the rebel film-makers, nor was there any desire on the part of the old commercial and the experimental the popular and the avant-garde has plagued the German cinema to this guard day-

Even though the manifesto failed to address the question of subsidies, it was tacitly understood that state support was needed to allow flm-makers to be auteurs. Realizing the cultural benefits of strong national cinema, the government   installed central funding agency, the 'Kuratorium Junger Deutscher Film' , which with 5 million marks supported the production of twenty

But in 1967, under pressure from the industry, so-called Subsidy Bill (Filmförderungsgesetz) was passed, the first of several that gave subsidies only to those films that were certain to in at least half a million marks-an unmistakable disincentive for the young film-makers and a shot in the arm for the intricate and interlocking system of loans, grants, sub cies as well as state and city governments has developed; on committee decisions and bureaucratic checks and balances. After the mid-1970s, German television has increasingly involved itself as a coproducer of films that could not be made otherwise. Because most of the films did not generate enough capital to pay for new productions, the number of films the New German Cinema produced was determined by the amount of subsidy available. In 1981 the German states (Länder) and the federal government made full 80 million marks available for native film production. Although the government subsidies opera, music; and theatre are still significantly higher; a sum of this magnitude carried obligations; particularly since the film audience in Germany showed shockingly little interest in the New German Cinema The state-subsidized 'artistically ambitious' German film had, morethan in any other country; accepted a secret cultural task: to present a new Germany to the rest of the world through the mirror of films . bring for 'its

Neither the Young German Film of the 1960s nor its successor; the New German Cinema of the 1970s, was ever a school or unified movement, but rather a loose alliance of autonomous auteurs who had little in common except their status as outsiders. Most of them were inexperienced, often self-taught film-makers who valued documentary authenticity Or essayist openness in their films higher than conventional   story-telling and dramatic agreed in their criticism of German society; of its capitalism, conformity; and complacency; wanted to serve as a critical voice in the life of the Federal Republic. This desire corresponded to a new interest in questions rarely broached in the cinema of the Adenauer era, questions about the stigmatized German past and its persistence in the present. Not surprisingly the first two feature-length flms of the 'Young German Film' thematized this troubled relationship of Germans to their past. They they

The Young German Film was a cinema of resistance the mass-produced entertainment industry of the Nazi period and the 1950s, against the visual pleasure of lavish   productions; and against the ideology of conformism that fourished in the decade of the economic German genre, the provincial Heimat film with its unbroken tradition from the 1930s to the early 1960s. Its slick, richly coloured images of German ity seemed to them deceitful movie kitsch; they also took offence at the continuity of themes and forms from the 1930s to the 1960s Still,  despite all its negative connotations-blood and soil, provinciality and kitsch\_this archetypal German film the young German film-makers and Peter Fleischmann's Jagdszenen Niederbayern (Hunting scenes from Lower poor people of Kombach' , 1971), and Reinhard Hauff's Mathias Kneissl (1971) deconstructed the genre conventions to create while Edgar Reitz both quoted and subverted the genre's ideology as well as visual form in his sixteen-hour television serial Heimat (1984) the 1980s allowed the filmmakers to reflect on German identity and trace those traditional (patriarchal, authoritarian) family and social structures that a few decades earlier made Fascism possible, even inevitable against again again.

## IMAGES OF GERMANY

In autumn 1977, the kidnapping and murder of a German industrialist and former Nazi Party official and the mysdeaths of three imprisoned members of the Baader-Meinhof terrorist gang as well as the severe counter-measures of the government (such as the news blackout and the witchhunt of leftist sympathizers) caused the Federal Republic's most severe political crisis since its inception The desire for deeper historical understanding of West Germany' s repressed past became overwhelming since all these events resonated with memories of the psychological terrorism of the Hitler regime memories which suddenly ruptured the collective mission to look for the roots of this crisis in the German past. At the suggestion of the Spiegel magazine, nine filmmakers associated with the New German Cinema, among them Schlöndorff, Reitz, and Fassbinder, collaborated to produce a film that would be both chronicle and commentary of the German autumn. The collective project, entitled Deutschland im Herbst (Germany in Autumn, was also means of countering the government's Kluge, 1978)

news blackout and an attempt to answer the 'official' to thirty-minute contributions by individual film-makers are not individually identified, even though the final 'look' of the film clearly carries the signatures of Alexander and his editor; Beate Mainka-Jellinghaus. On its surface, the film imitates the structure of a television views, and fictional scenes But it shows images tells would not have been possible on German television. It was here in this film, made cooperatively and without governmental subsidies, that the New German Cinema could articulate itself as a group, unified not by style but by an oppositional political stance\_ Kluge

It is no accident that a collective work such as Deutschland im Herbst inspired several projects dealing with 'the images of our country' Alexander Kluge elaborated on his short episode showing Gabi Teichert, the history teacher who with her spade for the roots of German tribution, staged conversation between him and his authoritarian leader; motivated him to look further into the history of the parent   generation in his so-called 'Federal Republic of Germany ~Die Ehe der Maria Braun (The Marriage of Maria Braun, 1979), Lola (1981), and Die Sehnsucht der Veronika Voss (Veronika Voss, 1982).

## Rainer Werner Fassbinder (1945-1982)

With Rainer Werner Fassbinder's untimely death at the age of 37, New German Cinema itself seemed to have come to a premature end. The sheer quantity of his creative output--more than films and television pro ductions fifteen years-had won him an undisputed reputation as the 'heart' of German Cinema; moreover his relentlessly critical perspective on West Germany made him appear as the 'conscience ofhis nation' .

Holding on to notions of high culture, experimentalism; and self-reflection, Kluge is surpassed only by Hans Jürgen more enthusiastic following in France than in Germany. His grand opus, the six-hour myth-laden jeremiad Hitler; ein Film aus Deutschland, is ultimately about the impossibility access to the past exists, only selfconscious simulation are   possible.

For Syberberg, film itself functions as myth-making medium, kind of compensation for the progress of techdemythologization by science, he says, finds an answer in remythologization thatonly film can accomplish in the sensory immediacy of its images and sound' . His earlier films Ludwig: Requiem für einen jungfräulichen König (Ludwig;

Requiem for Virgin 1972) and Karl (1974) are 'positive mythologizings of history through the devices of cinema' . Syberberg believes that Ludwig, the naïve late nineteenth-century of Bavaria, who built castles and supported Richard fairy-tale as well as Karl the popular writer who; without ever leaving brought fantasies of artificial paradises to millions of search for lost paradise. Ludwig and Karl both embrace archaic myths and utopias as a compensation for the increasingly hostile world of industry and commerce. Despite ironic geration, kitsch, and camp, both films are serious attempts to come to grips with the mythological dimension of deals with the soil in which the Third Reich grew and took shape, telos of both Karl mythic structures behind thehistorical figures andevents.

## THE CINEMA OF OUTSIDERS: WOMEN AND GERMAN HISTORY

Outsiders and misfits abound in German cinema Influenced by the American  independent film, sizeable underground film community has emerged in Berlin since the 1970s Mikesch, Lothar Lambert, Monika Treut have produced films that glorify sexual difference in ever new formal ways-from the comedy of Bettwurst (1970) to the threepart documentary Die AIDS-Trilogie (1989-90), both by Rosa von Praunheim; from the stylish thrillers Die flambierte Frau (1982) and Die Venusfalle (1988) by Robert von Ackeren to the sadomasochistic Surrealism of Monika Treut in Die grausame Frau (1986). It is no coincidence that most of these films eschew geographical and national identities; are more often than not filmed in New York or San Francisco and open to full houses in lesbian and gay film festivals around the world\_ they

has moved from radical experimental and feminist films to ethnographic film-making, often blurring the lines between them (as in Johanna dArc of Mongolia, 1988-9). Madame X-eine absolute Herrscherin (1977) and Bildnis einer Trinkerin (1979) subvert the conventional   portrayal of women as the passive object of the male gaze; Ottinger's female protagonists   return the travelogues , China: die Künste-der Alltag (1985) and the ethnographic epic of more than eight hours duration, Taiga (1991-2), seeks the exotic but in an unobtrusive way.

The politically engaged feminist cinema at the end of the 1960s originated in the context of the extra-parmakers set out to educate audiences about women-specific issues of discrimination and oppression (equal rights, feminist films consciously defined themselves against the melodramas of the called women's film mostly made by men. By the mid1970s, influenced by French theory; German feminists developed more radical theories centred around the filmic construction of the female subject and narrative ventions in general. New ways of story-telling and

Helma Sanders-Brahms's Deutschland, bleiche Mutter (Germany; Pale Mother; 1979) adopts formal elements of the feminist film (the presence of an authorial speaking and listening voice, the unorthodox narrative economy in the extensive fairy-tale sequence, the avoidance of the 'male gaze'), but places traditional women-specific interests (the relation between the sexes, the mother-daughter relationship, the critique of patriarchy) in the context of German history Deutschland, bleiche Mutter tells the story of the filmmaker's mother from 1939 to 1955 the perspective elements blend into each other.

Sander's voice over commentary vacillates between sardonic quips (reminiscent of Kluge) and autobiographical comments about the character that the film-maker plays in the film.

The emphasis is on her everyday experiences; on her desire to make sense of the highly ironic and self-reflexive examination of the radical student movement that failed to include women, voice over, photographs, and documentary passages including videotaped speech that Sander herself gave at a women's political rally in 1968.

## East Germany:\_The\_DEFA\_Story

## HANS-MICHAEL BOCK

The post-war division of Germany began with the establishment of the four occupied zones in 1945 American British, and French to the west, and Soviet to the east and was formalized by the consolidation of the three western zones into the Federal Republic of Germany and the conversion of the Soviet zone into the German Demo cratic Republic (GDR) in 1949.

capitalist production company and is a direct echo of Ufa, the biggest and most powerful film organization Germany ever saw, was in fact set up on the orders of the Soviet Military Government in Germany and for nearly forty-five years was the only film-producing entity in East Germany. Its original core was formed by a group of filmmakers who had spent the Nazi years either in exile or working as technicians in the film industry and who came cinema. DEFA itself was officially founded (as a Soviet company) the following year and passed into German control in 1949. On 1 October 1950 the 'DEFA-Studio für Spielfilme was formed for the production of feature films. were set up for newsreels and

documentary films and for animation films. In 1953 were officially designated as VEB (Volkseigener Betrieb), companies owned by 'the people' . they

## STRUCTURE

DEFA used the traditional studio structure modelled on Ufa or the Hollywood of the 1930s, but with one crucial difference: in Hollywood, and even in Nazi Germany, there were other; competing production companies to turn to; in the GDR there was only the one, controlled by state (and Party) authorities.

Through the HV all lected as part of the state At the same time all funds for   production   officially came from the state and for film as an art and propaganda medium. budget. paid

Officially there was no censorship but all films had to pass 'Zulassung' by HV Film.

The DEFA (ex-Ufa) studio at Potsdam-Babelsberg followed the tradition of big studios by having virtually all film-making personnel on its payroll: writers, directors, set designers , cinematographers , technicians; and even some actors. This led to high standards of craftsmanship (particularlyin set design, where theold German tradition of masters and apprentices was kept alive) But it severely restricted artistic risk-taking: ideas and scripts were sub jected to series and party officials and reworkings by the 'Dramaturgen (story of the state long

It was difficult to become director without following strictly preordained path which included attendance at the Film School at Babelsberg: DEFA, however, was able attract  many of the country's leading writers as occasional OI regular script-writers. By curious irony someimportant literary works such as Jurek Becker's Jakob der Lügner ('Jakob the liar') or Ulrich Plenzdorfs Die neuen Leiden des jungen W ('The new sorrows ofyoung W') started life as banned film scripts and were only later made into

Relying on broad reservoir of stage actors, DEFA developed some firstclass screen performers, some (in particular Manfred and Jutta Hoffmann) becoming popular stars and remaining so even after had left the for the west. Erwin Geschonneck (who had worked with Brecht) became the biggest East German star and sometimes used his influence to banned films (including his own released.

## EARLY CLASSICS

The suppression of Das Beil von Wandsbek marked the end of period which in five years had already resulted in some lasting classics, beginning with Wolfgang Staudte's anti-Nazi film The Murderers Are Among Us (Dir Mörder sind unter uns) , shooting for which started on 16 March 1946, before DEFA was even officially founded.

Stylistically; The Murderers Are Among Us goes back to pre-Nazi traditions of expressionist lighting and one big dilemma of the early DEFA was how to react to the 'Ufa tradition of Nazi films and how to produce anti-Fascist stories with technicians and artists who had worked in the Nazi fim industry for an audience which was used to the slick escapist style of Nazi cinema. The official policy was not to employ directors or writers who had blackened their names with propaganda films, while on the other hand accepting all others who were 'merely' technicians

In his first feature film Ehe im Schatten 'Marriage in the 1947) Kurt Maetzig told the story of a married couple of actors who are driven to suicide by the Nazis parts of Germany, was the most successful of the period with an attendance of more than 10 million in the first director Veit Harlan was   expelled the cinema (Ironically; the music of Ehe im Schatten was composed by Wolfgang Zeller; who had written the score for Harlan's from

The most important films were those that used history to tackle contemporary problems. Erich Engel's excellent Affaire Blum (1948) dealt with a real crime the early 1930s when the state authorities covered up murder by blaming an innocent Jew. Both Maetzig and writer giant IG Farben and the Nazis Staudte's Der Untertan (1951), biting satire on the German petty bourgeoisie and was for years banned in West Germany. from from

This era of DEFA ended around 1950 when, after the foundation of the GDR the educated and rather liberal Soviet supervisors and film officers left and handed DEFA over to such German Stalinists as Generaldirektor Schwab Sepp

## SOCIALIST REALISM TO THE THAW

With the Cold War; the Communist authorities' grip on 'their'  film intensifed. DEFA's production reached an absolute low in 1952 and 1953, when only five films per year were finished. In July 1952 at a party conference of the ruling Socialist Unity Party or SED (the Communist Party) and then in September 1952 at a conference of filmmakers , a new doctrine in film-making was proclaimed: to intensify the 'methods ofsocialist realism' 'positive heroes' dealing more with 'problems of the German using

The most famous film in response to this was Kurt Maetzig's seiner   Klasse | Führer   seiner Klasse (Thälmann, son of his class leader of his class' 1953-5), German Communist were in the present the GDR as the inheritor of the German cultural tradition by adapting   famous fairy-tales and classic dramas such as Schiller's Kabale und Liebe ('Intrigue and love' , 1959 , directed by Martin Hellberg) and Lessing's Mínna von Barnhelm (1962, also Hellberg).

In order to enhance its international reputation DEFA also engaged in a series of coproductions, mainly with France (including Les Aventures de Til V'Espiègle, directed by Gérard Philipe in 1956), but also with Sweden and with Germany. An East-West German co-production of West

The most important representative of this generation Wolf, son of the Communist writer Friedrich Wolf.

Some of the most interesting stylistic approaches were to be found in films that dealtwith the Fascist past; a field ihn Amigo (' called him Amigo' , 1958) told the story of in Berlin who hides a fugitive from a concentration camp. Prague-trained Frank Beyer took the Spanish Civil War as the background for Fünf Patronenhülsen ('Five cartridge cases' , 1960). The influence of the new Czech and Polish cinemas was even more in evidence in Beyer's Königskinder ('Royal children' , 1962) and in Der Fall Gleiwitz ('The Gleiwitz case' , 1961), directed by Gerhard Klein from script by Günter Rücker and Wolfgang Kohlhasse. (Klein and Kohlhasse had previously collaborated on Berlin-Ecke Schönhauser ('Berlin-Schönhauser corner' 1957) and number of other films with stories taken from everyday They boy

## CRACK-DOWN

On 13 August 1961 the East German police and army closed off the border to West Berlin and started building the Wall. Before the year was out DEFA started shooting und deine Liebe auch (' and your love too' , Frank Vogel, 1962), about two brothers torn between west and east Konrad Wolfs Der Himmel ('Divided sky' , 1964), from the novel by Christa Wolf (no relation), offered highly artistic treatment of the topic and provoked an intense discussion as to whether DEFA films should be geteilte

After the 'bleeding wound' of the open border was sealed intellectuals and artists-especially those favourable to socialist ideas-hoped for more freedom to criticize the many internal social and political problems. Frank Beyer hinted at economic difficulties in Karbid und Sauerampfer ('Carbide and sorrel' , 1963), one of the best German film comedies .

Nearly the whole of DEFA's production was indicted, including Klein's Berlin um die Ecke, Egon Günther's satire Denk bloss nicht; ich heule ('Just don't think, Im howling') Günter Stahnke's Der Frühling braucht Zeit ('Spring needs time'), and Jürgen Böttcher's Jahrgang 45 Born in 45') A few months later even Frank Beyer's Spur der Steine ('Trail of the stones with Manfred Krug\_which had a successful première and was set to represent the GDR at the film festival in Karlovy Vary\_was 'withdrawn circulation after Party-organized protests in an East Berlin cinema from

The top executives of DEFA were removed and the careers ofsome film-makers weredestroyed. Stahnke never made an interesting film, Beyer retreated to the theatre in the provinces and made TV series before returnnever directed a feature film but became an important documentary film-maker and painter.

REVIVAL

The first interesting film to come out of Babelsberg after the débâcle was Konrad Wolfs Ich war neunzehn (1967),

which also marked the beginning of a lasting partnership between Wolf and writer Wolfgang Kohlhaase Meanwhile a new generation of film-makers was preparing to leave the film academy at Potsdam-Babelsberg and to enter the DEFA studio, bringing with them new ideas\_ back to neo-realism, started to work under the banner of 'dokumentarischer Spielfilm' ('documentary fiction film a term coined by Lothar Warneke) mixing fictional and documentary elements in stories from everyday life\_ abandoned the concept of the 'positive hero and 'typical characters' , turning instead to the depiction of individuals with specific problems. These new trends were underpinned by theoretical treatise entitled 'Sub jektiver Faktor und Filmkunst' ('The subjective factor and film art') edited by the Party Academy of the SED and written by a former student of the film school, Dr Rudolf Jürschik. He later became 'Chef-Dramaturg' (artistic head) of the DEFA studio. Going they telling They

The biggest success of those years was Heiner Carow's Paula' , 1972), a bitter-sweet love story of a young woman who tries to fulfil her love against all obstacles. The script was written by Ulrich Plenzdorf; whose banned screenplay 'Die Leiden des jungen W' had become popular as a book and a play. Another banned screenplay which had become a successful book, Jurek Becker's Jakob Lügner, finally made it to the screen in 1974.Directed by Frank Beyer, and his first feature film after Spur der Steine, it broke with the traditions of the anti-Fascist genre by treating the story of Jews in Nazi ghetto as sentimental fairy-tale. It was successfully shown at the Berlin Film Festival and was nominated for an der Oscar.

## A TIME OF CAUTION

After all the leading directors-including Konrad Wolf with Der nackte Mann auf dem Sportplatz ('The naked man in the sports ground' , 1973)had run into problems with contemporary topics, they reacted by turning to the 'safe genre of anti-Fascism Or to 'camouflagefilms which employed literary classics or the biographies of artists as a means of exploring the conflict between individual and society.

Junge Leute in der Stadt ('Young people in the city'), set in Ali. Kahane's film was a success with young audiences, who responded favourably to its light touch and youthoriented critique of everyday life. But his more radical project, Die Architekten; which openly criticized the circumstances leading to the creation of sterile suburbs, encountered many obstacles , and it was only finished in 1990, on the eve of reunification.

Lothar Warneke in Addio; of the students' rebellion in the west through portrayal of the life of Georg Büchner.

When filmmakers tried to deal openly and critically with contemporary issues, as did Carow in Bis daß der Tod euch scheidet ('Till death you do part' , 1978), and Wolf and Kohlhasse in Solo Sunny (1979) the Party immediately reacted with a 'discussion' in theofficial press demanding 'positiveview ofthe 'advantages ofsocialist society' completed after considerable tug of war between the studio and the Party-was banned. Film-makers resorted once more to camouflaging their critique by filming stories about women (Warneke's Die   Beunruhigung ('The disturbance ), 1981); using successful books as subjectmatter (Gräf with the excellent Märkische   Forschungen ('Researches in the Brandenburg Marches'), 1982); Or exploring anti-Fascist themes (Beyer with Der Aufenthalt;

The style of these films was cautious and professional; heavily dependent on dialogue supported by cinematography; and few risks with the precarious power of the image. Creative imagination could, however; be given freer rein in the safe genre of the children's film as in Gritta von Rattenzuhausbeiuns ('Gritta of Rats-in-ourhouse' 1984) by director and cinematographer Jürgen Brauer. good taking

Throughout the rest of the 1980s all his projects were shelved and he returned to film-making only after the collapse of the GDR.

## SELL OUT

In the 1980s growing numbers of entertainment films were imported from the the centralized distribution service; thereby pushing DEFA's own films even more into the of art houses and youth clubs. The production heads of DEFA thus faced new dilemma\_ and one which mirrored the situation of the East German they needed to up with western film technology; for which there was very little hard currency available To the interested they also needed to take a more critical stance towards the social situation, which the were reluctant to allow. One of the last attempts in this direction was Warneke's Einer trage des anderen Last mild plea for tolerance between Church and state and startingfor more in-depth debate. Meanwhile DEFA intensified its contacts with the west by entering into co-productions with Austria and pre-selling films to West German television, and using the money thus raised to buy colour film stock from the west (the East German ORWO stock was slow and lacked brilliance) or the rights to popular music. Ties with West Germany became closer: companies and television stations, arranging for the shooting of West German films in East Germany (Frühlingssinfonie ('Spring symphony'\_ 1982), with Nastassja Kinski) or producing films commissioned by West German television. In 1988 finally made a film openly aimed at the West German was directed by Frank Beyer; who had recently been working mainly in the west, from script by Wolfgang Kohlhasse, returning here to his favourite genre of realistic comedy set in Berlin in the immediate   post-war years, and used an ensemble of popular actors from both sides of the Wall. ghetto keep public keep point

## EVASIVE STRATEGIES

and film-makers responses to them, led east central European cinemas in the post-war period to adopt a number of distinct strategies, which can be summarized as follows:

## Historicism

In the Hungarian and Polish cinema, and to a lesser extent the Czech, there is often an obsessive interest in national history seen through the prism of an evil fate and the notion of an irreversible catastrophe by which both individuals and entire communities are foredoomed. Over the years strategies have evolved for overcoming this fatalism through ironic distance and black humour; often highly 1966; Cutting It Short, 1981), and Péter Bacsó (The Witness , which triggers off a process of collective therapy in the

## Documentarism

A subtle mixture of fiction and documentarism is particularly characteristic of the development of the Czech school of the 1960s, whose sociopolitical diagnoses were ofincreasing concern to the Communist authorities, even in films as seemingly innocent as Forman's The Firemen's work of Evald Schorm (Everyday Courage, 1964; Martyrs of Love, 1966; End of Priest, 1969). The Czech model analysing selected segment of society as sample of the system at large soon caught on both in Yugoslavia-in the work of Aleksandar Petrovié, živojin Pavlovié, and Boro Dragraduate of FAMU in Prague and the author of Provincial Actors (1978), succeeded in further refining the Czech formula and adapting it creative for along lines.

In east central Europe the cinema of fiction in particular is characterized by its documentary quality and attachment to concrete reality; on the basis ofwhich it can then fact no conflict or contradiction in terms between fiction and documentary, from which feature films constantly draw inspiration; and it is no accident that many of the eminent directors of east central Europe-Miklós Jancsó, Andrzej Munk, Miloš Forman, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Károly Makk, to name but a few-made their débuts as directors of documentaries. In their hands the original 'document' which however remains firmly rooted in the minutiae of the reality represented .

## Literary affinities

East central European cinema has frequent recourse to literature as major source for theme, style; and philo sophical outlook on life, and considerable number of eminent Czech Polish, and Hungarian films are tations of classical and contemporary   literary works Writers working in films have made a substantial contribution to the   development of film art in Poland a foremost novelist and film director whose authorial films reflect and develop the themes of his novels, and Jerzy Stefan  Stawinski who has written some of the Polish school's most significant screenplays. Since the 1960s the Czech cinema patronage   of Bohumil and Milan Kundera\_ Without Tibor Károly Makk would never have created the masterpiece of Hungarian cinematography that is Love (1977). This literary connection; a quasi-symbiosis ofliteraadap Déry

ture and film, enabled Polish and Czech cinema in the 1950s to evolve a unique formula for transposing a literary work freely and creatively to the screen.

## Aesopic film language

This stems from the harsh rigours of censorship imposed on art and cinematography in the eastern bloc countries For several decades a subtle use of allusions , subtexts , and understatements effectively enabled film-makers to communicate with their public above the head of the censor; though at the same time it created hermetic cultural code which made the deeper Skolimowski less readily accessible to foreign audiences. Faced with the impossibility of   depicting anything directly film-makers   perfected this method of communication, resorting in the process to rich variety of semantic tropes and stylistic devices whenever needed to circumvent the censor's taboos. On occasions it yielded magnificent artistic results; as with Ashes and Diamonds (1958) Ashes (1965, based on the novel by Stefan Zeromski) and The Wedding (1972,based on Stanislaw Wyspianski's   political   symbolist drama) all directed by Andrzej Wajda; The Red and the White (1967) and Red Psalm (1972), by Miklós Jancsó; The Stud Farm (1978) by András Kovács; and Károly Makk's Another Way (1982). Other, less unequivocally successful examples include István Szabó's Father (1966) and András Kovács's Labyrinth, and Krzysztof Kieslowski's No End, filmed after martial law in 1984. Aesopic language continued to be practised in Polish cinema well into the 1980s. they

## Artistic values

Throughout east central   Europe the cinema has sistently been treated as a full-fledged in its own right, painting, and music-an equality inspired by the Romantic notion of correspondance 1956,the notion of artistic cinema has played a prominent The authorial film is not commodity but contemporary art form, directed to mass audience This approach is closely linked with the notion of the mission of art and the responsible position of the artist characteristic of the Romantic cultural tradition in Poland and Hungary in particular and renewed in the period of Communist rule. Accordingly; the filmsociety and tackle the most vital issues of the nation. This is how Wajda, Munk, Zoltán Fábri, and Jancsó have seen their role, and the same could be said of Mészáros, Jerzy Zafranovié, and others, who are similarly fascinated by the heritage of national history and culture, and dedicated to perpetuating its memory. art

## CHRONOLOGY

Cinema in the countries of east central Europe falls into four basic stages of development:

## 1945-1956

The nationalization of the film industry according to the Soviet model in Poland, Hungary; and Yugoslavia in 1945, and in Czechoslovakia in 1948, brought with it certain advantages but also imposed heavy; and sometimes unsupportable, burden on the cinema. Theobvious advantages of state investment and permanent subsidies were bought at the heavy cost of extreme centralization and the administrative-ideological dictate of the Party. The fact that the cinema of 'real socialism' is not governed by money and the laws of the free market did not mean that film-makers enjoyed total freedom for their artistic creation: were allowed only so much as lay in the interests of state patronage. Every project was controlled and analysed ab ovo by the official party apparatus until the screenplay was finally approved for production. Prior to release the film was again subjected to a terminal inspection. This was particularly true during the Stalinist period. But in Poland even as late as 1982 the tempestuous viewing of Ryszard Bugajski's Interrogation tion of the film's photographic materials by neo-Stalinist they

its kind in the entire history of east central European cinema

In view of the high degree oF ideologization to which Eastern bloc cinema was subjected in the 1940s and 1950s, one may well wonder why films enjoyed such popularity among mass audiences. The answer reveals another basic cultural difference between east central Europe and the west in those years. Paradoxically; education of the masses awakened the cultural needs of a collectivity living behind hermetically sealed Iron Curtain and denied access to the socalled bourgeois imperialistic culture of the west. The spontaneous demand for cultural far exceeded their strictly limited supply. In a time of ideological deprivation people flocked to the cinema in their millions regardless of what film was shown. Comedies , war films or films about the partisans, thrillers, spy or detective stories, adventures, dramas, even a film about factories might prove attractive, independently of its ideological message. In this manner the cinema of east central Europe survived the first decade after the giving birth on occasion to such quality films as Géza Radványi's Somewhere in Wanda   Jakubowska's The Last Good Soldier Schweik (1955), Károly Makk's Liliomfi (1954), and, perhaps most famously; Andrzej Wajda's A Generation (1954) goods being Stage

## 1956-1968

The beginnings of the Thaw in 1953-6 and the decisive social and political events of 1956 resulted in a flowering of the Polish cinema in the second half of the 1950s, followed by a renaissance of Czech, Hungarian, and Yugoslav cinema First the Polish film school (between 1956 and 1960),and then in the 1960s the newwaves in CzechosThese included Andrzej Wajda, Andrzej Munk, Wojciech Aleksandar Petrovié and Dušan Makavejev in Yugoslavia. The fact that these film-makers and others like them were able to make films of world standing was a direct result of the de-Stalinization process and the abandonment of the Socialist Realist doctrine in art. From 1956 onwards, though with a number of ups and downs, film-makers steadily wide margin of creative freedom of Polish cinematography in June 1955 resulted in the creation of Film-Makers' Ensembles, a unique form of self governing film-production body that gave significant degree of autonomy in decision-making to the artists concerned The best-known film ensemble was 'Kadr' which flourished from 1955 to 1968, and with which Wajda, gained

connected. The tradition of 'Kadr' was then carried on by the film ensemble 'X', years 1972 to 1983, and similar practices spread to other countries , the film ensemble 'Objektiv' in Budapest, directed by Peter Bacsó, enjoying particular prestige.

Increasing freedom led rapidly to international success at festivals and on the art-cinema circuits in the west. Wajda's Kanal (1957) and Ashes and Diamonds (1958) were followed by Kawalerowicz's The Devil and the Nun (1961), and Roman Polanski's début feature Knife in the Water A Blonde in Love (1965), and The Firemen's Ball (1967), Chytilova's Daisies (1966) and observation of the everyday and enlivened by humour and subtle eroticism.

Although this did not prevent the sporadic appearance of such eminent works as Polanski's Knife in the Water, Jerzy Skolimowski's Walkover   (1965), The   Saragossa Manuscript, lerowicz's Pharaoh (1965), and Wajda's Ashes (1965) and Everything   for Sale (1968), conditions remained tense throughout the period.

the spring of 1968 the Czech cinema enjoyed an unprecedented freedom in circumstances which suggested that de-Stalinization reality.

## The 1970s and 1980s

Of the many distinguished films produced in Slovakia between 1975 and 1985 (generally modest in scale, but none the worse for that), Jakubisko's magnifcent poetic fresco The Millennial Bee (1983) is in a class apart. This film saga about the Pichand family from Liptow displays bewitchingly sensuous beauty ofimages and supernatural screen events-a falling star; green rain, a spherical shaft with nature and its feeling of participating in something indestructible and more durable than the life of the individual bee, Jakubisko's epic film invests the fate dogging the industrious Slovak with a historical and philosophical dimension that makes it possible to look into the future with hope

The rise ofthe Solidarity movement refocused attention on politics. shipyard in August 1980 was recorded live by a team of makers , including Kieslowski and Holland, were involved with the Solidarity movement and their films contributed to the  political ferment of the time Pride of place, however; must go to Wajda's Man of Iron (1981), winner to Ryszard Bugajski's Interrogation (1982), which chronicled the nightmare of terror applied by the Stalinist security apparatus

Events in Hungary pursued a calmer course, with the authorities pursuing a reformist policy which was to lead to transition to liberalism and market economy at the end of the 1980s. Meanwhile in the early 1970s Jancsó continued his series of allegorical films with Elektreia (1974). Briefly tempted westwards to make the bizarre Private Public Virtues as an Italian-Yugoslav co-production, he returned to Hungary to make Allegro Barbaro and Hungarian Rhapsody theonly Hungarian film-maker to enjoy a world-widereputation Besides the established Károly Makk and Peter Bacsó, new talents had also emerged including Pál Gábor (Angi Vera, 1978) and András Kovács (The Stud Farm; 1978).

## Émigrés

Considering the amount of political repression exercised in the the post-war period, it is remarkable how few film-makers chose the route of emigration during those years . Those who did emigrate\_ abroad that had enjoyed in their home countries OI, for that matter; the success of some decessors from the waves of émigrés who escaped from who emigrated, however, on permanent or more Or less permanent basis, were at least four film-makers of excep tional talent: Roman Polanski and Jerzy Skolimowski from Poland Makavejev from Yugoslavia. Of these only Polaáski and Forman were able to carve out distinctive careers for themselves in the west. they

For time in the 1960s Skolimowski   attempted to pursue film-making career on both sides of the Iron Curtain, but the banning in Poland of his anti-Stalinist

Roman Polaáski also made Britain port of call after leaving Poland, directing two quasi-surrealist horror films , Repulsion (1965, with Catherine Deneuve) and Cul-de-Sac (1966), before settling in the United States. The foreigner's eye-view evidentin the use ofLondon locations in Repulsion deployed to even greater effect in Chinatown (1974), which must count as one of the best films ever made about Los Angeles. But Polanski's most distinctive feature remains the cruelty of his vision and the voyeuristic and sadistic   approach to characters (particularly women) teristics which he would have found easy to exploit in the repressive Polish context.

By contrast with Polanski, Forman is by temperament a gentle director. His first film in the United States, Taking off (1971), attempted to study American family life and teenage rebellion with the same delicacy of observation Thereafter he was to tackle an assortment of themes and subjects. An interest in the fragile borderline between sanity and madness sustains both One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975) and Amadeus (1984), but otherwise he found it difficult to recover the consistency of style that had marked his early work.

providing lifeline for struggling industries, it brings with it the risk of standardization and homogenization of film production; and a consequent threat both to indito nationalization of film production is changing the character of the films produced and threatening their cultural identity in a world where the commercial entertainment cinema genres prevail.

## THE POST-COMMUNIST ORDER

Following the political changes of 1989, the cinemas of and Slovak republics, and the fast disintegrating Yugoslavia entered an entirely new phase Political censorship was done away with, but the shift to market economy led to drastic cuts in state subsidy for the cinema, particularly in the Czech Republic and Hungary, and a massive in indigenous film production. In the component parts of the former Yugoslavia (with the exception of Slovenia) production underwent a catastrophic decline as the country was plunged into civil war. drop

by the state\_ Over feature films were made in Poland in 1992, and this level of output was sustained through 1993. In Hungary and subsidized production left massive facilities lying idle and collapse was averted only by renting out studio space and services to film and television companies from the west. thirty

The cinemas of all the post-Communist countries have come to depend increasingly on co-production for their survival. Co-production with both east and west was not uncommon in the past; but it always left space for a core of production which was national at heart. Now it has become a necessity and, as such, a mixed blessing: While

Films of eminent artistic quality still continue to be produced on a national basis or as international co-productions by the leading directors of central and eastern Europe. might mention here The Double Life of Veronica (1991) by Krzysztof Kiešlowski, Virginia (1991) by Srdjan Karanovié, Europe; Europe (1991) by Agnieszka Holland, Meeting Venus (1991) by István Szabó, Silent Touch (1992) by Krzysztof Zanussi, and Arizona Dream (1991), made with French money by Emir Kusturica Paradoxically, the Bosnian émigré Kusturica made his film abroad at the very time the French documentarists Thierry Ravaletand Alain Ferrari were making their disturbing documentary Un jour dans la mort de Sarajevo in Bosnia Will the future spare Knowing the range of talent of which these countries dispose, and the strong national traditions developed, some sort of revival can be predicted. But, as the smaller countries of western Europe have already learnt, film production without protection or subsidy is hard to maintain when serving only a small domestic market and exposed to the blast of foreign competition.

This was particularly evident in Lithuania, where the talented director Vitautas Zhalakevichius worked, and the Ukraine, where the tradition of Dovzhenko was carried on by Sergei Paradjanov and his cameraman turned director Yuri Ilienko, whodirected the beautiful White Bird with a Black Spot (Belaya chernoy otmetinoy; 1971) ptitsa

Western sources on the cinema of the Thaw generally tend to focus on the serious' films which garnered the most international attention, yet an extremely popular hitof 1956 was Carnival Night (Karnavalnaya noch) , the debut of Eldar Ryazanov; one of the most prolific and successful comedy directors of the last years. Comedies had calling for revival. Carnival Night pits a young enthusiastic group of Komsomol youth, who are planning a funagainst bureaucrat who, afraid of what the higher-ups might say, wants to make the occasion serious, educational, and uplifting by of place.

Comedies allowed directors and the audience to fun at the highly bureaucratic Communist system, even if, until glasnost, never questioned its foundation. were not only extremely entertaining and therapeutic, but also mirrored the absurdities of Soviet life and changing social and political concerns Ryazanov followed Carnival Night with more hits, many of which were hailed by critics, the masses, and the educated élite alike, and remain some of the most watched films of the last forty years: Beware of Automobiles (Beregis' avtomobila, 1965), An Office Romance (Sluzhebny roman, 1978), Train Station for Two (Vokzal na dvoikh, 1983) Forgotten Melody for Flute (Zabytaya melodiya dlya fleyty, 1987), and most recently The Promised Heavens (Nebesa obetovannye, 1992). poke they They

Ryazanov was not the only successful director of comedies in this era. Leonid Gaidai (totally unknown outside comedies which entertained audiences through the 1960s

and 1970s The Diamond Arm   (Brilliantovaya ruka), for example, starred the well-known comedian Lev Nikulin as bumbling overworked economist whose wife sends him on what is meant to be restful cruise. He becomes em broiled in adiamond theft when, due to mistaken identity the diamonds are encased in a cast on his arm. The police then use him as bait to catch the thieves, and a riotously way at the

The films that brought Soviet cinema back on to the world stage (first and foremost the festival stage at Cannes) were those which reconsidered Soviet history, focusing on human beings and downplaying the virtues of the monolithic Communist system After a decade of Cold War politics, the earnest and emotional lyricism of the films coming out of the Soviet Union stunned the West. The first film to be recognized both at home and abroad was Grigory Chukhrai's début, The First (Sorok pervy) Forty

1956 remake of a silent film. Set in the civil war, this love story of two stranded enemies, a Red commissar and her White prisoner; which ends tragically when she carries the complexities of the characters' emotions rather than the inevitable conflict of love versus duty. Lev Anninsky (1991), well-known cultural and film historian who has written widely on the Thaw; calls the film celebration of the human body a hymn of love full of 'spirituality' , running in parallel to the revolutionary theme duty

war epics made in the last years of Stalin's rule, they do reach back to some of the highly emotional wartime films such as The Rainbow Russian soldiers, dressed in white camouflage, fought the Germans and won in a symbolically pristine white winter landscape, the soldiers in the war films of the Thaw period are literally mired in mud as slog their way to battle Bleak, burntout, muddy landscapes   predominate and signala new, unglorified view ofwar. The focus shifts from a common struggle and victory that unites 'the people' to the toll the war takes on individual human beings and their relationships. they

In 1956 there were at least two other films which paved the way for new trends in Soviet cinema: Alexander Alov and Vladimir Naumov's Pavel Korchagin, starkly romantic reinterpretation of Nikolai Ostrovsky's canonical Communist text How the Steel Was Tempered, and Marlen Khutsiev's and Felix Mironer's début Spring on Zarechna Street (Vesna na Zarechnoy ulitse), the first of a number of films by Khutsiev on the lives and loves of young adults. This is a story of a young, naïve teacher and her adult student who resists her attempts to tame and educate him. One of the film's innovations is the open ending which only hints at the further development of the love story It opens up the protagonists through wealth of physical details in specific, mostly urban Soviet environment. This film has given rise to two different trends, one leading to numerous sentimental youth films but, more importantly, one and poetry of the spirit.

Khutsiev's best and most controversial later film, The Lenin Gate (Zastava Ilyicha), cut, re-edited, renamed, and finally released as I Am Twenty (Mne dvadtsat let, 1962-5), is a much more complex story of the lives of three young their way in the revitalized capital, Moscow. In this film the city is as much a star, and as full The first sign perhaps that the Thaw was to be short-lived was the attack on this film and its censoring and mutilation by the studio

Two major themes were to predominate and overlap in the films of the Thaw period: youth coming of age and revisionist views of the war; focusing not on its glory but on its human cost. I Am Twenty was a subtle exploration of these themes , which had been poignantly and dramatically raised in the late 1950s by an internationally recognized triptych of war films: Kalatozov' s The Cranes are Flying (Letyat zhuravli, 1957); Chukhrai's second feature, The Ballad of a Soldier (Ballada soldate, 1959); and Sergei Bondarchuk's début based on a short story by Mikhail Sholokhov, Destiny of a Man (Sudba cheloveka, 1959).

These films allowed their audience the cathartic experi 'sharing the World War which touched the life of every family in the pain,

In his finalthoughts, visualized on the screen, he imagines his wedding; that will now never take place, to Veronika, the young woman he left behind. The 'war film then becomes the story of   Veronika's suffering, her transformation from girl to an emotionally dead 'fallen woman who finally is redeemed by helping the war wounded and sharing their and grief, and by rescuing a little also named Boris , from certain death pain boy,

Though the plot is pure melodrama, unusual casting and the excellent acting by Alexei Batalov and Tatiana Samoilova (as Boris and Veronika) combined with revitalized cinematography made this film the most highly acclaimed of all Soviet films of the 1950s. In international reputation it would only be surpassed by Ivan's Childhood (Ivanovo detstvo; 1962), Andrei   Tarkovsky's first featurewhich continued the youth in war theme, but presented it in a dramatic new way.

Tarkovsky takes sparse, detached , realistic war of a young scout's exploits and eventual death, and interchildhood and of the mother and sister he lost in the war. As with other revisionist war films of the period, there with only hints of fighting indicated by offscreen sounds, and a hallucinatory, burntout cal reality. What distinguishes Ivan's Childhood , however, is Tarkovsky's visual and often expressionistic camera work and sound, all used to present the sharp contrasts between Ivan's and images of the is dark, deeply shadowed, distorted, with a silent, a manchild whose normal childhood is destroyed by the war and his psyche warped by the desire to avenge his dead family. While Tarkovsky was highly original in his style and presentation of his young hero, films focusing on children's experiences were quite popular, particularly in diploma or début works story living dirty,

(Anninsky invents the term 'paedomania" to describe the times ) Partially under the influence of Albert Lamorisse's The Red Balloon, directors sought the fresh perspective of children not burdened by life's experience, politics, OI ideology: Marlen Khutsiev's Two Fedors (Dva Fedora, 1959), Georgy Danelia and Igor Talankin's Seriozha (1962), and, probably the best in this genre, Mikhail Kalik's Man Follows the Sun (Chelovek idyot za solntsem, 1962), boy's lyrical, fable-like journey through the city to face a number of separate vignettes both and evil. good

In widely attended conference on 'The Language of Cinema" held in March 1962 at the Film-Makers Union Tarkovsky's teacher the director Mikhail Romm touted cinematic language. When the film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in August, the instant international recognition (along with Sergei Paradjanov) into the leading figure of Soviet cinema in the west, but also was in the future to exacerbate his problems with the cinema bureaucracy and the censors at home

While Kalatozov; Kalik, and Tarkovsky, among others, may have stylistically challenged the realism in the Socialist Realist formula, other directors, both younger and older; were seeking a new realism through understated In the Thaw, variety of filmic styles was once possible; and the poetic lyricism of Ivan's Childhood could exist side by side with the narrative prose (A esli eto lyubov? , 1962). style. again

period was remarkable in the variety of individual  styles and the number of different generations of directors all producing flms; film-makers flourished many producing the best work of their careers Of the older  generation, besides Raizman and Kalatozov the most 'striking new beginning was made by Mikhail Romm;

Raizman 's film is Romeo and Juliet story\_a highschool romance which is destroyed by town gossip and the suspicious meddling of parents and teachers who do not believe in the possibility of innocent love. A shrewd observer of changing social mores , Raizman grounded his film in the physical reality of everyday life, and pointed to a need for a different way of treating the young in these new times. The oldest Russian director (91 in 1994), for almost the whole history of Soviet cinema-but has received little recognition abroad, perhaps because he managed to survive all the political changes unscathed, and western critics are suspicious that those who were allowed to make films under Stalin must have done so by compromising themselves. Raizman's films reflect much that is universal in human nature, always  presenting memorable and real human and this perhaps is the best explanation of his ability to persevere. living beings ,

Andrei   Konchalovsky's first two feature films rep resented a new development toward poetic yet gritty The First Teacher (Pervy uchitel, 1965) was shot naïve young Communist teacher tries to enlighten and rescue a local girl, who falls victim to the merciless patriarchal traditions of the area. The of Klyachina (Istoriya Asi Klyachinoy; 1966, also known as Asya's Happiness (Asino shchastie) ) documents the hard life of a typical Soviet collective farm (shot on location with the farmers playing all but the major roles) while the story of a handiAlexthe Thaw came to an end in 1967.

In Nine of One (Devyat dnei odnogo goda) Romm raised contemporary issues and problems, capturing the mood of the 1960s through the philosophical discussions and actions of the protagonists-two scientists, rivals for the same woman, one of whom is under sentence of death because he has, for the benefit of humanity, knowingly exposed himself to harmful radiation.

Romm followed up with documentary masterpiece, Ordinary Fascism (Obyknovenny fashizm), providing the voiceover narration for selected German archival footage which recorded the ordinary lives of German soldiers under the rise of Fascism. While attempting to answer the question clear though unstated parallel with Stalinism

A child of the Thaw period, the Moscow International Film Festival was founded in 1959 in order to provide showcase for Soviet films, and re establish the contact with western cinema which had been severed under StaFor flm-makers, film students, and particularly the intelligentsia, the Thaw was an exciting time of cultural neo-realists; the French New Wave; Bergman, and Kuro sawa joined the Soviet flm-makers of the 1920s as role models for directors in a search for a new, more truthful realism\_

missar was shelved not only because it offered an uncomfortably ruthless portrait of a female commissar during the Revolution; who leaves her baby with a Jewish family to go back and fight, but it also presented the Jews more sympathetically than the Communist heroine. Jews were simply a taboo subject in cinema and remained so until glasnost.

Not only was the wider public denied access to major these films had a stifling effect on new movements and experimentation. The Party and industry bureaucracy reasserted their control over the artists, and censorship increased with the banning of more than hundred feature films in the so-called of stagnation from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. The critical brand of neorealism developed by film-makers under the Thaw was not to survive, and instead a kind of 'pedagogical realism was to prevail throughout the 1970s. period

## STAGNATION

Although the best of the Thaw films broke new ground in both stylistics and thematics, many established directors sought the relative   safety of noncontemporary subjects by filming recognized literary classics during the Thaw and stagnation periods. The best ofthese such as Grigory Kozintsev's Don Quixote (1957). Hamlet

Literary adaptations of Chekhov provided particularly of the Brezhnev era and its precursor at the turn of the century. The best were Konchalovsky's Uncle Vanya (Dyadya Vanya, 1970) and his brother Nikita Mikhalkov's Unfinished Piece for the Piano (Nezakonchennaya pyesa dlya mekhanicheskogo pianino, 1977). Both directors excelled in lush, beautiful cinematography; and recreating period pieces with outstanding actor himself, Mikhalkov already had hit with his 1976 film Slave of Love (Raba lyubvi) , backward-looking; at times comic, melodrama about chalovsky' s and Mikhalkov's films stood out as technically accomplished in period that in general was marked by increasing professionalism. In the 1970s the Soviet film industry had an eye to commercial success, and the best of Hollywood once became a role model Player acting popular again

Television provided stiff competition\_ and, despite a few big hits, cinema attendances dropped from close to 5 billion tickets per year in the 1960s to 4.2 in 1977, with (still high) average per capita attendance of 16.4.

Such 'sliceoflife' (bytovye) films  dealing with contemporary social issues and ranging from comedies to melodramas dominated the screen in the 1970s and early 1980s. Moscow like many of these films, appealed primarily to female audience with its consideration of the many roles women are called upon to play in Soviet society and the tensioh between their and private life\_ The best women directors such as Larissa Shepitko (Wings   (Krylya), 1966), Kira Muratova (Brief Encounters Farewells) , 1971), and the Georgian Lana Gogoberidze (Some Interviews On Personal Matters   (Neskolko   intervyu po lichnym voprosam) much public Long

Although the number of women feature films was small, their contribution was disproportionate to their numbers as tended to make honest, hard-hitting, and controversial films. Muratova's Brief Encounters was quickly buried, and The Farewells banned outright. Soviet society, with women carrying the major burden subtly disturbingly questioned the value and the results of the much-touted Communist emancipation of women\_ they Long They yet

It was not only as directors that women contributed to the cinema of the period. Inna Churikova, arguably the greatest foundly influenced the depiction of women on screen Directed almost solely by her husband Gleb Panfilov in collaboration that began in 1968, Churikova has created a number of memorable female protagonists from the bits the same courage in real life (in The Beginning (Nachalo) Have the Floor (Proshu slovo, 1977); and in a remake of Vse volod Pudovkin's silent film Mother (Mat; 1926) she played the famous peasant woman turned revolutionary. Churikova combines physical vulnerability with inner strength and has an unusual, luminous beauty, her face often blendingsad and comicalexpressions with an excruciating honesty.

Despite the censorship, theincrease in bureaucratic red tape, and the pressures put on directors to conform, the sheer number of banned films testifies to the artists continued pushing of the boundaries of the permissible, and perhaps even to some willingness on the part of the studios to back problem films. Nikolai Sizov, in the 1970s the director of Mosfilm, the largest of all the Soviet studios, was very adept at balancing the demands of overand were all released , even the extremely experimental of prints which assured rather poor distribution.

THE 1980s: GLASNOST AND PERESTROIKA

It is possible to identify three somewhat overlapping in the decade of film-making since the beginness, and the exciting release of banned films; perestroika (1988-91), the restructuring phase; and post-perestroika (1991-4). periods

However, even before the onset of glasnost, the best of the films that dealt with contemporary social issues had understated the socialist message and concentrated on The early 1980s   also witnessed number of attempts to produce films fundamentally critical of the corruption of the period of stagnation. Rolan Bykov's The Scarecrow (Chuchelo, 1984) raised public outcry for its depiction of the brutality and sadism of   provincial schoolchildren who torment a newcomer wrongfully accused of tales on them to the teacher. The team of Vadim Abdrashitov and script-writer Alexander Mindadze produced a number telling

of films which exposed the absurd nature of Soviet society through complex narrative-strategy and a web of fantastic, even surreal occurrences 'often steeped in allegory In The Train Stopped (Poezd ostanovilsya, 1982), for example; the police investigation ofa train wreck produces multiple versions of the story as townspeople shield themselves behind lies, a fitting commentary on a society for too buried in hypocrisy. Film-makers were ready for glasnost, and the cinema industry was among the first to respond to it. Repentance (Pokoyanie, 1984-6) surreal, tragicomic denunciation of Stalinism by the Georgian film-maker Tengiz Abuladze, was the first major glasnost film, released after political bankruptcy and its Stalinist heritage; were to be long

In the film industry the era of stagnation officially ended and glasnost was inaugurated at the Sth Congress of the Union of Film-Makers in 1986 with the election of a new, liberal leadership under the 1960s director Elem May

to reconsider banned films. By 1987 most of these films were released, among them Askoldov's controversial The Commissar, Kira Muratova's Brief Encounters and Faresubject of   Jewish emigration) Elem Klimov's Agony (Agoniya; 1976shelved for a sympathetic portrayal of the last tsar), and two outstanding films by Alexei German Trial by the Road (Proverka na dorogax; 1971-not released because of a sympathetic portrayal of a Second World War POW) and My Friend Ivan Lapshin (Moy Stalinist 1930s) The glasnost period was marked by the richness of artistic talent even in the period ofstagnation Andrei Tarkovsky; who had decided to stay in the west in 1984 after filming Nostalghia and thus had become a nonperson, was now not only reclaimed by the cinema establishment, but even canonized after his death at the end of 1986. Long drug

contemporary film-maker in the Tarkovskian tradition of 'difficult' non-commercial, auteur cinema was Alexander Sokurov; whose increasingly silent films refo cused the viewer's attention on the essential visual nature of film-something that had almost been lost in Socialist Realist cinema (most of which could have been listened to on the radio) and something that Tarkovsky had kept alive in his own work. Freed of censorship and miraculously able to keep financing his films, Sokurov produced marvellous visual elegies, including almost silent documentaries on Tarkovsky; Yeltsin, and Landsbergis . One

By 1988 Soviet cinema had entered the restructuring, or perestroika; stage. and changes occurred with dizzying speed. By 1990 Goskino had lost most of its power to control and censor films, and a new hybrid structure of partly   private and partly   government-subsidized having to find private sponsors for their films\_ New money, much of it from the grey market or illegally gained, was laundered through films In 1991 an astounding 400 or so feature films were made, but almost none released , as the state run distribution system collapsed. As the Soviet Union disappeared, did the country-wide cinema organizations, and by 1992 young directors, particularly from non-Russian former republics, were re establishment of governmental subsidies for the whole of the CIS.

The International Film Festival in Moscow is rapidly being outmanœuvred by a private festival, the Cinetaur (Kinotavr) held in Sochi and sponsored by Mark Rudinshtein; one of the new businessmen-patrons of the arts. The 1994 Cinetaur festival found critics and film-makers alike bemoaning the death of the movie theatres: with average audiences of seven to ten people, many are closing

their doors, and those that are still open screen primarily American movies, which are cheaper to than Russian movies are to make are expensive and there is much competition from video boom (fuelled by pirated films) cable TV, and even first-run films on TV. New laws to and distribution are lacking, and there is general agreement that unrestrained capitalism is running the once great cinema industry into the ground. However, 137 feature films were produced in 1993 and some will surely find their way into movie theatres, given the continuing demand for homegrown fare, now called otechestvennye filmy (literally; films of the native land')-

These films, ofthe perestroika phase; explored the legacy of Stalinism, exposed the depths of degradation of Soviet society; and broke every taboo of Socialist Realism with vengeance (especially the prohibition against nudity and sex: one critic noted that every film had to have Stalin and a naked woman in it) also ended up depressing or confusing their audiences and driving them out of the novie theatres. Some film-makers tried to examine the heritage of Stalinism directly, and documentaries once become important. Realistic feature films on Stalinism were often meant to look like docu dramas, shot in gritty black and white to recreate the atmosphere of the times: the best of these were Coma (Koma, 1989), the first depiction ofwomen's prisoncamps, by Nijole Adomenaite; and Defense Counsel Sedov (Zashchitnik Sedov; 1989), the story of a lawyer who clears men falsely accused in the hysteria of 1949, only to discover that all the witnesses he called have in turn been arrested Seeking new stylistic devices film-makers abandoned realistic narrative and opted for a grotesque Surrealism instead The most notable of the latter films were Valery Ogorodnikov's Prishvin's Paper Eyes (Bumazhnye glaza Prishvina, 1989) and Sergei Soloviev's Black Rose Stands for Sorrow; Red Rose Stands for Love (Chernaya roza emblema pechali, krasnaya roza emblema lyubvi, 1989) which begins with a lunatic listening repeatedly to medical report ofStalin's death and treats the viewer to everything the Russian Revolution) to images of contemporary youth cults They again from

In this period, cinema acted as barometer of social strophobic, communal apartments , broken families, familial as well as random, meaningless violence, rape, drugs, prostitution, crime. the total alienation of youth, and the embarrassing helplessness of their parents. As during the Thaw; films about the problems of youth predominated, a strong of rock and roll as in Valery Ogorodnikov's The Burglar (Vzlomshchik, 1987). One of the most watched films of 1988 and perhaps the best of the new youth films was Vasily Pichuls Little Vera (Malenkaya dose

hard-hitting, realistic exposé of working-class life in the Soviet Union and the failed promises of Comyet touchingly vulnerable teenager; outstandingly played by the newcomer Natalia Negoda, is the most memorable and strongest female character in all of recent cinema. (The film was scripted by Pichul's wife Maria Khmelik) Fifty million Soviets saw the film, most of them lured by the first sex scene in Soviet cinema.

However, many of these contemporary social melo dramas did not abandon Socialist Realism, but simply turned it on its head\_ were still formulaic films trying to tell people Or not to live, and are full of new clichés: communal apartments instead of shiny, clean ones, social outcasts instead of heroes of labour; and a requisite unhappy ending instead of a happy one They how how dirty,

Since 1991, film-makers   have moved into post-per estroika phase. After much selfexploration, and stylistic and thematic experimentation in film, directors are attempting to make more commercially viable films. Light comedies and modest, feelgood films are making a comeflood of depressing dark films, pejoratively labelled and pornukha  (porno). Vyacheslav Krishtofovich's Adam's Rib (Rebro Adama, 1991) typifes this new type of film. It is a warm story, both humorous and touching, of three generations of women cope and survive in these difficult times. The director relies on excellent acting (the film stars the incomparable Inna Churikova) to help create real characters the audience can identify with.

## Cinema in the Soviet Republics

## JEAN RADVANYI

For the studios of the southern republics, as in the rest of the USSR, the Thaw that followed Stalin's death signified double rebirth. First, there was noticeable return to film-making after the 'era of few films' when only Stalinist masterpieces could be produced. It had been a particularly dark for these small studios: of just less than 290 period

full-length films produced in the USSR between 1945 and 1955, the fve central Asian republics only produced nineteen and the three Trans-Caucasian   republics only produced twenty-two, twelve of which were from the relatively favoured republic of Georgia. This renewal of production assumed particular importance in two republics:

in Turkmenistan the decision was taken in 1953 to rebuild the Ashkhabad studios. which had been completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1948, and the first film was produced at the new studios in 1954 In 1955 the first Kirghizian film was made; Vasily Pronin's Saltanat was produced in Moscow but filmed on location, and the studios built in Kirghizia during the war had, until then\_ only produced documentaries. In general, the end of the 1950s was a period ofinvestment: in the capitals of several republics new studios were built and fitted with the most

Secondly; on the creative side, the rebirth in production was marked by the arrival of a new generation of directors whose stylistic break with the past was comparable to the storm in Russia were the débuts of the Georgians Tengiz Abuladze and Rezo Chkheidze with Magdana's Donkey (1955), in Armenia that ance occurred slightly later in central Asia, with Shukhrat Abbasov's first films, All Makhallia is Talking about It (1960), and You're not an Orphan (1962) in Uzbekistan, and Bulat short, simple films were radically opposed to Stalinist academicism: Their heroes were ordinary people in concrete surroundings described in quasi-sociological or ethnic way. This break with the past was not easily achieved. Abuladze has spoken ofhis intense struggle with the directors of the Tbilisi studios who tried to halt the filming of Magdana's Donkey and change its directors. To complete the project it was necessary to enlist the help of intellectuals and, in particular, writers. However, the rupture brought about by the Thaw was such that directors of previous generations who were still active, like Amo BekNazarov or Mikhail Chiaureli, were now unable to create convincing works.

## THE PARADOXICAL ROLE OF MOSCOW

In the years that followed, the role of Moscow to be eminently paradoxical. On one hand, the authorities created exceptional circumstances in which the national cinema of small and economically weak republics could made every effort to restrict productions with production system had two major peculiarities: a lack of any direct link between the decision to make a film and the decision to distribute it, and the insistence from the centre on minimum production quotas for each republic. However, this resulted in the emergence (albeit at the price of struggles for the directors) of authentic works anchored in national realities, far removed from the level represented by Sociàlist Realism. proved they tiring

The role of the Moscow film training institutes (VGIK, the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography, and,

from 1960 for scriptwriters and from 1963 for directors, the Two-Year Further Diploma) was crucial to the development of the national cinemas. These institutions trained all the future directors in an incredible melting-pot of nationalities around prestigious masters: Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Trauberg, Dovzhenko; and their successors Savchenko, Raizman, Romm, Gerasimov. Bearing in mind the largely positive effects of 'goodwill' selection (there was republics), the particularly fertile cultural atmosphere in Moscow in the between 1955 and 1965 had found effect on and the friendships developed here would last for period

nicians led to remarkable experiment born from the spirit formed in Moscow. Several of the more gifted directors from the films in central Asia, one of the objectives to attract (Legend of the Icy Heart, 1958), Larissa Shepitko (Torrid Heat, 1963), Vladimir Motyl (The Children of Pamir, 1963), and Andrei Konchalovsky (The First Teacher, 1965) made their débuts. The impact of these Moscow-trained film-makers inspired many in the republics: Tolomush Okeyev was the sound engineer and Bolot Shamshiev the sound assistant and actor for Larissa Shepitko. Konchalovsky was the co script-writer of several Kazakh, Kirghiz, and Uzbek films of the period. being

## THE GEORGIAN AND ARMENIAN SCHOOLS

The 1960s and 1970s witnessed the arrival of a group of ways, surged into the breach opened up by Abuladze and Chkheidze There was great diversity of themes and styles , but the influence of Italian neorealism and the French Wave on many directors was apparent-in and Frunze Dovlatian, for example At the same time, domithe traditions pioneered in the great films of the silent era. In the major studios managed to develop a new cinematic language that was rooted so firmly in the centuriesold traditions of these two peoples that it was possible to distinguish an actual national cinematic school Rezo Chkheidze immersed himself in the realist tradition to describe the daily heroism of the ordinary people (The Father of the Soldier, 1964). Tengiz Abuladze used the past to reveal great moral questions, in vision which mixed naturalism and symbolism in the style of the great poet from the end of the nineteenth century; Vaja Pshavela (The Incarnation, 1967; The Wishing Tree, 1976).

Fall of Leaves (1966) and There Was Singing Blackbird (1970) struck whole generation with their poetically sad, lucid vision of the which was still in force.

He stood out for his way of tackling difficult brave allusions to religion and genocide, which were still taboo subjects . Narrower in scope, Malian's work (The Tri1967; We Are Mountains, 1969; The Father, 1972; and Nahapet, 1977) was more creatively inscribed in Armenian culture and history the use of humour; he marked his films with tragic seriousness clearly linked to the recent history of his people. This is what sharply  distinguishes  the majority of Armenian Days angle,

The situation in Armenia, where the studios also had a was fairly similar; even and directors was smaller than that of Gruziafilm at Tbilisi. From New Wave ofcreative artists such as Armand Manarian (Tejvejik , 1961), Dmitri Keussaian (Master and Servant, 1962; and Avdo's Motorcar, 1966), and Bagrat Hovhanessian (The Green Grape, 1973;and Autumn Sun, 1977), three figures standout: Frunze Dovlatian, Henrik Malian, and

films from Georgian films which are otherwise similar in many ways. Malian's best films   speak, even if metaa broken harmony; the loss of integrity in a country that remains at heart Armenian.

## CENTRAL ASIA: THE PERIOD OF THE 'NEW WAVE

Without overlooking the contribution of pioneers such as all central Asian republics , as the moment of birth for the cinemas of central Asia. Having broken with the tradition of using the young Moscow-trained directors set about anchoring the art of the cinema in hardly seemed to favour the development of the seventh art\_ The role of VGIK, and of the Russian and Caucasian directors who came out to central Asia to make their first films, has already been mentioned\_ Also important was and even more nationalwriters   emerged Mukhtar Auezov; Chingiz Aitmatov; Olyas Suleimenov\_all prominent writersplayed an active role in the cinema of their

ideological constraints: the civil war (Shots in the Karach Shukhrat Abbasov; 1968), the Second World War (You're not an Orphan by Abbasov; 1962; The Daughter-in-Law by Khodjakuli Narliev; 1972), the transformation of the countryside (White; White Swans by Ali Khamrayev; 1966; The Sky of approach and the cinematic language had been comdocumentaries, allowed much space for the traditions of these nomadic or recently settled peoples, even if Islam remained a taboo subject. The influence of the French and Italian New   Waves was also clear; as in Elior Ishukhamedov's early films. In Tenderness (1967) he adopted a poetic approach in order to examine urban society; and the film caused sensation There were also explicit references to the great Japanese and Indian masters (Kurosawa, and Toshiro Mifune would not look out of place in certain sequences of Okeyev's The of our Childhood or Without Fear by Ali Khamrayev.

The best works from the five republics spring from both an indisputable kinship and a true diversity. A kinship of recourse to tragedy as well as melodrama) indicates as much a shared historical and cultural tradition as the Soviet mould However, there is also real diversity in the outstanding films, expressing the profound differences which separate these peoples: the mountain nomadism of the Kirghizs, the great open spaces of the steppes for the Kazakhs, the desert civilization of the Turkmens. the ancient urban civilization of the Uzbeks and Tadjiks, with the latter also greatly influenced by the Persians .

## THE CINEMA AND ITS PUBLIC

From the mid-1970s, these republics reached their optimum output, producing four feature-length films year and a large number of shorts. However; by the end of the decade a certain lackof vitality was beginning to make itself felt. The new, young talents, like Suren Babaian in Armenia (The Eighth of Creation), 1980 and Davlat Khudonazarov in Tadjikistan (The First Morning of Youth, Day

1979), had difficulties making their names\_ In Georgia were more numerous-Alexander Rekhviachvili 'Chronicle of Georgia in the Nineteenth Century; 1979), Rezo Esadze (The Windmill by the Town, 1981) Nana Djordjadze Journey to Sopot, 1980), and Temur Babluani (Migrating preaking the Moscow monopoly. they

The weight of the Moscow was increasingly felt, n the level of production. Goskino, as the supervising Juthority, tightened its control on both scripts and the inancing offilms, as well as their circulation Films whose Juthors had strayed from the prescribed track often had heir distribution reduced to a minimum. Official critics iccused them of transgressing the borders of sacrosanct ocialist Realism and lapsing into nationalist tendencies. Jirectors were banned at nternational festivals. At the same time, by using the bias f state commissioned productions, either for television Goskino favoured the rise of a commercial 'inema closer; in its opinion, to what the Soviet vanted. A kind of specialization became apparent in the idiculous comedies in Azerbaijan, Westerns, oriental 'pics, and musical melodramas in central Asia, all this as vell as films linked to the ideological interests of the noment which were put at the top of the production ists.

## THE UPHEAVALS OF THE 1980s

After Gorbachev had come to power; film-makers from the southern republics took a more active part in denouncing the harmful role played by the central administration which they felt had disadvantaged them. Several of them 1986 at the 6th Congress of the prerogatives at Goskino concerning choice of production. Some of them went on to political career in the new assemblies and the Tadjik film-maker Davlat May

Until 1991, the situation seemed to favournationalproductions Federalcensorshiphadallbut disappeared while state budgets allotted to the cinema by backing. In many studios, the number of films made beat all previous records and there was also an emergence of independent producers, either co operatives Or private, and often Kelechek (Tolomush Okeyev) Salamalekfilm (Bolot Shamchiev) +1 (Rezo Esadze) Samarkandfilm (Ali Khamrayev) , etc

But alongside these innovations , increasing commercial pressures on the cinema led to pursuit of fashionable themes. Each republic produced its own films about the gulags, the Mafia, drugs, and delinquency. For the few films of interest such as The Stain by the Georgian A Tsabadze (1985) and The Bastard by the Azerbaijani Vagif Mustafayev (1989) there are which have contributed to the public's growing disillusionment with national cinema.

Since 1991, independence for the republics has created completely new situation full of uncertainty While western films and videos ofall kinds; usually pirated, flood across the screens, national productions are in period of crisis: national authorities baulk at the prospect of renewing financial backing to studios believe ought to be selffunding. The film-makers hit back by showing that this would be the death of all creative national films . Certain states (Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan Turk menistan) have agreed to finance emphasis has been put on co-productions in the that this will finance the re-equipping of studios  However, the increase in armed conflicts and the economic crisis have reinforced instability and it is to be feared that, in the republics , the blossoming of national cinema may shortly be no more than one that is, paradoxically, linked to the Soviet experiment. they hope

## Turkish Cinema

Cinema arrived in Ottoman Turkey almost the same year as in the west. Pathé Frères' representative in Turkey; the Romanian Sigmund Weinberg, conducted the first film screening in early 1897 at the Restaurant Sponeck in Beyoglu; the cosmopolitan district of Istanbul. Within few years, film screenings had spread to all the major cities of the Ottoman Empire.

The first film productions in Ottoman Turkey were docu1914 that a film made by a Tuik was completed: The Demolition of the Russian Monument at St. Stephan; a documentary made by Fuat Uzkinay, an officer in the Ottoman army.

Early productions by Turkish film-makers followed this pattern, documentaries produced for the Army Film Centre (AFC) which had been formed in 1915 by Enver Pasha, the General Commander of the Ottoman Army and the Minister of The first Turkish feature film was not produced until almost twenty years after screening. Weinberg began to shoot The Marriage of Himmet Aga in 1916, for the AFC, but it was not completed until after the First World War. The first feature films Association; The Claw (1917) and The Spy (1917), both directed by a young journalist, Sedat Simavi. being War. again

The loosening of censorship and the of taboos encouraged the rise of a new generation of directors who broadened approaches in the different studios. One ofthe first genres to benefit from this opening was the documentary, which could at last tackle subjects that had for long time been banned. One of the best examples is the Armenian documentary school led by Ruben Gevorkiants at the Haik studios (Islands; 1984; Requiem, 1989) and by Harutiun Khachatrian (Kond, 1987; The White Town, 1988). Notable young film-makers from this generation are the Georgian Zaza Khalvashi (There; with Us, 1990), the Uzbeks Djakhongir Faiziev (Kiadia, 1988; Who Are You?, 1989) and Zulfikar Musakov (History of a Soldier; 1989), or the Tadjik In Kazakhstan the wave, imposing a stylistic break with noir films influenced by the new German and American film-makers Fassbinder, Nugmanov (The Needle, lifting

French and German vaudeville, operettas, and highly exaggerated German melodrama were simply recreated for the camera, with only the names of characters changed. It is fitting that the films made by the only director of the   period reflected the pre ency prevented the creation of a truly national cinema in theatrical traditions ofits own, on which the foundations of a national Turkish cinema could have been built.

The coming of the multi-party system under the premiership of Adnan Menderes witnessed tremendous transformations in the political, economic, cultural, and social structures of Turkey. An open economic system replaced the existing one; with the help of the industrialization programme supported by Marshall Aid. A great number of Anatolian small businessmen moved into Green Pine From this base the film industry witnessed an explosion in production that would lead the Turkish and 1947 fiftyeight films had been made, whereas by 1956 the total number of Turkish films produced had increased to 359.

This intensely affected Turkish Filmmakers who felt the need of a new and genuine national film culture began to debate the formal and narrational principles of a cinema inspired by the visual, literary, theatrical, and musical traditions of Turkey These debates continue to this day, but several short-lived film movements emerged in the 1960s which aimed to establish the cultural foundations and aesthetic principles ofa national Turkish cinema. The first was social realism; initiated by ment were Seden's For the Sake of Honour, Atif Yilmaz's The Criminal (1960), and two Erksan films, The Revenge of the Serpents (1962), a story of one man's fight against rural and traditional authorities, and Summer (1963), which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festivalin 1964.

Another;   conflicting, national film movement developed at this time; directly opposed to the ideas of Refig. Milli Sinema, based on Islamic ideas, was started by director and critic Yücel Çakmakli and colleagues Salih Diriklik and Mesut Ucakan, who had come together within the National Association of Turkish Students. This movement produced several important films during the early 1970s, including The Converging Paths and My Country.

A young and talented film director and critic, Halit Refig, was inspired by the ideas and works of the great Turkish novelist and thinker Kemal Tahir. Refig, together with his colleagues Metin Erksan, Atif Yilmaz; and Ö.Lütfi Akad founded an important, but relatively short-lived film movement; the national cinema movement (Ulusa Following his début film Forbidden Love (1960) Refigdirected a series of films inwhich hedeveloped his notions of a Turkish national cinema: The Stranger in Town (1963), film about the conflict between western and eastern (i.e. Islamic-Turkish) values, Four Women in the Harem (1965), 1 Lost my Heart to a Turk (1969), and Mother Fatma (1973).

## THE NEW TURKISH CINEMA: 1970-1994

In 1970 the Turkish film industry looked in danger of collapse; there was no base for consistent domestic film production; no dependable foreign markets, the technical quality of most Turkish film was poor, and almost half the existing movie theatres had closed down in the of competition from television. However; the Turkish film industry survived, thanks largely to a new generation of innovative, talented directors who entered the field, crea New Wave of Turkish cinema.

In 1975 he directed Return of the Soldier, a film employing psychological elements which, up to this point, had been lacking in the Turkish cinema. He went on to direct The Herd (1978), and The Enemy (1980), both of which were conceived and scripted by Güney; who was in prison and unable to direct. With Strike the Interests (1982), own distinctive style, with epic narration, rich characterization; and successfully organized rhythm and tempo. These films introduced new elements into the nation's cinema; notably a richness of detail and sensitive and elaborate sense of Güney irony.

He directed his first feature in 1968, but it was his second film, The Hope (1970), which ushered in new era in Turkish cinema. Inspired by Italian neorealism, Güney developed his own personal style of epic and poetic realism, and attempted to create a new, distinctive film language suitable for Turkish subjects Güney

Other directors who made major contributions to the development of Turkish Cinema included Serif Gören, Erdin Kiral, and Ömer Kavur. Serif Goren, inspired by Güney; produced several commercial melodramas with a realistic and poetic touch He directed number of including The Earthquake (1976), The River (1977), Station (1977), The Remedy (1983), Blood (1985), and You your (1986), which displayed mastery of the depiction of nature, but which had weak narrative structures .

The 1980s and 1990s saw several new tendencies emerge in the mainstream of Turkish cinema Throughout the 1980s, so-called 'women's films were extremely popular: These mostly told the stories of marginal women (prostitutes) who do not actually live within accepted Turkish society. Towards the end of the decade benefited from the country's traditional narrative forms, and visual and artistic culture.

## The Arab World

At the turn ofthe century; social and economic conditions throughout the Arab world were totally different from those in Europe and the United States, where the develop ment of cinema had been closely linked to the growth of industrialization. The cinema was exploited in Europe and the United States as a commercial entertainment for largely working- and lower middleclass audience now with money to pay for its entertainment needs, and, even a secular; commercial entertainment quite unrelated to traditional forms of Arab Arab world the end of the nine teenth century was an era of colonization and European domination, s0 that many of the very early film showings were arranged by and for foreign residents.

Both starred his daughter Haydée Chikly, who also appeared in Rex Ingram's 1924 feature The Arab, which starred Ramon Navarro and Alice Terry.

Usually in the Arab world the first flm productions, like the first screenings, were the work of foreigners. In Egypt the Frenchman De Lagarne commissioned a foreign authentic national productions usually followed within

Elsewhere in the Arab world public screenings of films were delayed for socialor religious reasons: the first public shows did not occur until 1908 in Aleppo; arranged by some Turkish businessmen, and 1909 in Baghdad, when films of unknown origin were shown at the al-Shafa house. Occasionally local scenes were shot by the Lumière operators, partly to add to the attraction of their programmes for local audiences, but principally to be offered as exotic novelties to members of to be supplemented by popular audience A twotier system of distribution-new imported films in luxurious but expensive air-conditioned cinemas and cheap trashy productions shown in poor conditions to remains common in many parts of the Arab world.

Thus, in Egypt and Algeria, screenings of the Lumières Cinématographe were organized as early as 1896 in the back rooms of cafés, but only in those cities with large numbers of foreign residents: Cairo and Alexandria, were arranged for wider audience, those responsible tended to be local entrepreneurs to the west. In Tunisia example, Albert   Samama, also known as already imported other western  novelties, such introduced the cinematograph to Tunis audiences in 1897. Chikly, indeed, is true pioneer; since he subsequently for

a few years, but overall film production remained low Chikly's pioneering the Egyptian Mohamed Bayoumi made a short film, Al bash kateb (The Civil Servant) , in 1922. But subsequently in Egypt just thirteen silent with Qubla fil-sahara (Kiss in the Desert), directed by a Chilean émigré of   Lebanese origin, Ibrahim Lama and Leila , directed by Istaphane Rosti and Wedad Orfi and starring the stage actress Aziza Amir. While Leila is generally considered the first national' film (in that it was conceived and realized by Egyptians)  the most important of these early features is generally agreed to be Mohamed Khan's 1930 adaptation of Mohamed Hussein   Heykel's novel Zeinab. In addition two feature films-Al-muttaham (The Taht sama Dimashq (Under the Mughamarat Elias Mabrouk (The Adventures of Elias Marbrouk, 1929), in Lebanon film-makers made great use of some parts of the Arab world as film over sixty features shot in North Africa alone before the end of the 1920s

In Lebanon; where cinema attendance was the highest in the Arab world, little progress was made after Julio de Bucci and Karim Bustany's   pioneering sound film hayakel Baalbek (In the Ruins of Baalbek 1935). Only seven other features were made in Lebanon before 1952-none with any lasting significance-and there was no production at all in Syria or Iraq before 1945. ped by Bayn

## THE 19305

The coming of sound confronted Arab film-makers with such as higher  production costs and greater technical demands, and the employment of foreign directors , mostly Italians, was common in early Egyptian sound cinema. Sound was also problem for distributors, as differing languages and dialects mented previously unified markets. But sound also allowed the possibility of closer links with audiences, through the use oflocal languages and dialects and, above all local music and cinema of genres rather than of auteurs: farces produced by Togo Mizrahi, the bedouin tales of love and adventure by the Lama brothers, and Yusuf Wahby's stage adap tations\_ What was to become the dominant genre, the Egyptian musical, made its first tentative appearance as early as 1932 with Mario Volpi's Anshudat al-fuad (The the scope of Egyptian radiosingers such as Mohammed Abdel Wahhab, Oum Keltoum (first seen in Fritz Kramp's Attrache acquired huge followings throughout the Arab world frag song Song

Arab cinema became synonymous with Egyptian cinema, as Egyptian producers gradually came to dominate film markets throughout the Arab world. Initial progress 1930s,when the Misr studioopened, that Egyptian feature film output passed double figures for the first time, going on first of twenty-fve films a year in 1945. The bulk of these films may have little lasting value lasting film tradition in Egypt. Theatrical influence was very strong at this time, with three leading figures   from becoming involved in cinema. Al-Rihani, best known for his stage persona as Kish Kish directed the first FrancoEgyptian coproduction, Yacout Effendi-an adaptation of Marcel Pagnol's Topaze-in 1934. But critics are united in praising, as a first example of totally independent film all realistically at Egyptian life, which was directed by the short-lived Kemal Selim (1913-45) peak they

Though producers were usually seeking-in an unsophisticated way\_to create popular mass art imbued with national values , they remained very vulnerable to imported films. Far from giving support or offering tariff barriers, governments tended to see cinema simply as source of tax revenue, usually at rates far higher than in the west. Even

After 1945 the basis of an industry was created in where two Egyptian coproductions in 1945 were followed the 1958 revolution which finally put an end to British dominance. Critics have singled out two of these as of particular note, Abdel Jabar Wali's Man al-mas'oul? is responsible? 1956) and Kameran Hassani's Saïd Effendi (1958). In Egypt, however; the immediate post-war period saw something of boom in film production, as pro duction levels rose to over fifty films a year; total that Iraq being

has been largely maintained into the 1990s. As a result, Egyptian films came to dominate the Arab film market and impose the Egyptian dialect as the 'natural' language for Arab films. Most of this output still comprised undemanding melodramas and farces, with a liberal helping of songs and dances, but from writers-among them the future Nobel   prize-winner Naguib Mahfouz-began to involve themselves in filmmaking.

His most characteristic work comprises lively tightly scripted studio dramas, mostly with a realistic favour, though on occasion-as with the expressionist thriller Raya wa Sakina (Raya and Sakina, 1953)he explored other genres. Among his major films of the period are Shabab imra (A Woman's Youth, 1955), Al-qahira thalathin (Cairo '30,1966) and Al-Qadiya 68 (Case 68, 1968). and

Youssef Chahine is a more cosmopolitan figure. He too began in the mainstream of Egyptian cinema, working initially as assistant director and making his début in 1950. His twenty films of the next two decades showed his mastery of the genres of Egyptian cinema: the social drama with Ibn al-Nil (Son of the Nile, 1951); the melodrama with Sira' fil-wadi (Struggle in the Valley; 1954, which introduced Omar Sharif); the historical epic with Al-nasir Salah aldin (Saladin, 1963); and the peasant drama Al-ard key

The virtual nationalization of the Egyptian film industry; after the establishment of the General Organization of Egyptian Cinema in 1961, served for a time to give some support to serious film-making in Egypt. Among the films produced by the State are most of the major films of the 1960s, works such as Al-haram (The Sin, 1965) by the prolific Henry Barakat (born 1914), and Al-bustagi (The Postman, 1968) by a newcomer, Hussein Kamal, as well as works by Saleh, Seif, and Chahine

But nationalization was to prove a financial disaster. As result, perhaps, Egyptian cinema did not experience the kind of renewal common in the Islamic world (and elsewhere) in the 1960s.The one major new film-maker to emerge was never able to create a real career for himself, though his 1969), received international acclaim.

## SYRIA TO THE GULF: THE EASTERN ARAB WORLD

In Iraq, by contrast; the private sector of film production failed to build on the base established before 1958. Nevertheless a number of films were produced, the best known of which were Al haris (The Watchman, 1968), directed by a leading actor; Khalil Shawqi, and Al-zaniyun (The Thirsty made by the British-trained Mohammed General   Organization for Cinema, which achieved autonomy in 1964,had produced some documentaries when it turned to feature film production in 1977, beginning with Faisal al-Yassiry's Alsixty

The contradiction histories through the medium ofinternational film co productions is nowhere more apparent than in Jamil's Al-masala alkubra (Clash of Loyalties, 1983), which uses   British technicians to chronicle the Iraqi struggle for liberation from the British and even tells the story of this struggle from the viewpoint ofthe British colonizers (led by Oliver Reed).

## THE MAGHREB

In addition, new national cinemas came into in the 1960s in the Maghreb, where distinctive voices found expression though most of the film-makers were European-trained and the influence of France was all-pervasive. In Algeria the roots of the new cinema in the liberation struggle. At the time of independence in 1962 there were three organizations in existence. The first was within the context of the National Liberation Front by the Frenchman René Vautier; which was organized to produce agitprop material and remained in existence for six The second was the independent production company Casbah Film, run by Yacef Saadi, which spe cialized in international coproductions such as Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle 0f Algiers (1966) in which Saadi played historical role in the liberation struggle, and Luchino Visconti's adaptation of Albert Camus's novel The Outsider (Lo straniero, 1967). The third centre was the newsreel   organization the Office des Actualités Algériennes, founded by Mohammed Lakhdar Hamina, which being lay

also produced feature films and became the focus for the project to nationalize film production in 1964. By 1969 the Office National POUr le Commerce et FIndustrie Cinématographique (ONCIC) had acquired a monopoly of importation and distribution as well as production.

Because ofthis state control, there is a remarkable homogeneity about early Algerian production. The first wave of films produced reflected the liberation struggle: the compilation Dawn of the Damned, 1965) by Ahmed Rachedi, and the fictionalized accountofthe struggle Rih al-Awras (The Wínd from the Aures 1966) by Mohamed Lakhdar Hamina. Both directors went on to reshape the narrative of liberation for popular audience, Rachedi with Al-afyun wal-ãasa (The Opium and the Baton, 1969) and Lakhdar Hamina with December (1972) and, especially, his epic production Waga'i' sinin al-jamr (Chronicle of the Years of Embers, 1975).

The first practical attempts by Africans to make 'African films in the Sub-Saharan region came about only in the mid-1950s. Master-minded by Senegalese documentalist and researcher Paulin Soumanou   Vieyra, these early initiatives were the lack of prOduction facilities and technical know-how.

The films produced were of low quality; with naïvely own filmographies. Unsuccessful though these pioneering efforts were, Vieyra and his friends are remembered for attempting to minimize the monopoly enjoyed by foreign firms and the Colonial Film Units in the production and distribution of films on the continent.

## AFRICAN CINEMA IN THE FRANCOPHONE COUNTRIES

It was not until the early 1960s that credible cinema industry began to emerge in Africa south of the Sahara. The man behind the new ambitious search for an indigen ous African cinema was the well-known Senegalese novelist, Sembene Ousmane\_ In 1962 he returned to Senegal having completed course under the tutorship of experienced Russian film-

In 1963, with minimal financial and technical and non-professional actors and prOduction staff, Sembene made his famous short film, Borom Sarret. Then in 1965 he made La Noire de 'Black girl') most vibrant film-maker, his pioneering role inspiring many others, west Africa. using

Sembene Ousmane's films won international acknowledgement. Borom Sarret was judged best first film won several prizes, including the top prize at the Carthage Film Festival, and the Silver Antelope at the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar in 1966. Since the early 1960s, and in the period following the collapse of colonial rule, Senegalese filmleading role in the ment of Sub-Saharan African cinema. Besides Sembene Ousmane, there were other Senegalese film-makers whose qualitative and quantitative contributions highly enriched the continents evolving film culture These include Djibril Mambety; whose films Badou (1970) and Parlons grandmère ('Let's talk, granny' , 1989) both won prizes at major African film festivals; Traore Mahama Johnson, director of Diankhabi ('Girl' , 1969); Beye Bene Diogaye, whose feature Seye Seyeti ('A man, women 1980) won major at Ouagadougou; and Bathily rapid Boy Diop prize

In the three decades since the early 1960s, vibrant film production culture has developed in several other francophone countries , notably Burkina Faso, Niger; Morocco and Tunisia These countries have   provided African cinema and productive film-makers, internationally renowned for their talents and creative enterprise Most notable are Idrissa Ouadraogo from Burkina Faso, whose work includes Yaaba (1989) and Tilai (1990), and, from Mauritania, Med Hondo, 0 (1970). Souleymane Cissé from Mali, creator of Yeelen and (1987), is the only African director apart from Sembene whose films have gained wide spread distribution in the west. Overall the practice of film-making in francophone Africa remains more per cent of African films have been produced by francophone film-makers Finye

The success of francophone film-makers is something of miracle given the very poor financial, technical, and human resource-base on which the practice has developed. There are a number of reasons for the success The dynamism and creative initiative of individual like Sembene Ousmane working antin establishing independent film ventures. At thesame time; in such francophone African countries as Senegal, a fair amount of support has been given to film-makers by the stateThis has helped alleviate the financial burden involved in the complex practice of film production, but it has also meant that the government censor has had hand in imposing limits on film production and has been able to stop the production Or circulation of certain 'unwanted' filmsfree

Unlike Britain, French colonial and post-colonial policies have been tendered around the concept of 'direct' rule resul in the direct participation of the French film establishment and, even the distribution. France has been a major provider offinancial resources to African film-makers, who have enjoyed the use of modern French studios for post-production pro cesses.  Many African and technical pro duction staff have received training at the best French Iting

cinema schools, and African film-makers have often opted joint-venture arrangements with the French Ministry of Cooperation, as well as individual French film-makers . Souleymane Cissé, for instance; routinely works with both French and African technical staff in his   production crews for

Inevitably; assistance from abroad has come at French Ministry of Co operation officials and French filmmakers COoperating are frequently accused of 'imposing their own aesthetic views as way of judging films" (Diawara 1992). This imposition has been manifested in the form of control and censorship of flm products by French authorities\_

## ANGLOPHONE AFRICA

The growth of film-making in anglophone Africa has been far slower than in former French colonies, even though from the very beginning film-makers from such anglo phone countries as Ghana and Nigeria have enjoyed some rare parts Under colonialism, anglophone Africa was better technically equipped for the development of what could have been an now infamous 'Bantu Film Projects' furnished Ghana and that did not happen in French colonies. Ghana is believed to have owned the best studios in Africa even before Sembene Ousmane made the first feature film in Africa. Meanwhile, Nigerian film-makers raised the standard of innovation as pioneers of what is referred to as the folk-

The so-called indirect colonial and post-colonial policies practised by the British are often blamed for the absence of strong cinema industry in this part of Africa The British colonial establishment lacked the enthusiasm to encourage the development of an indigenous African film such a process, the British trained few technical staff, and no attention to the education of African film and postcolonial indifference by the British towards the development of cinema in Africa has been tragic. Today anglophone Africa remains far behind francophone in the production of feature films. The only recognized Ansah (Ghana) Ola Balogun (Nigeria) Soa Gamba (Kenya) Abdulkader Said (Somalia) and one or two others. South Africa has produced several film-makers, notably Anant Singh, whose feature Sarafina proved both critical and financial success . paid Ang

With the collapse of the apartheid system in South Africa, and given the rich financial and technical resources available in the Republic (for so controlled long

only by whites) there is great that the cinema of anglophone Africa will leap forward. hope

## PROBLEMS OF TRAINING AND DISTRIBUTION

Throughout the history of African cinema African filmmakers have faced enormous difficulties in their trade\_ These difficulties often looked so insurmountable that it is miraculous that so many films have been made\_

One of the greatest handicaps faced by African filmmakers is the lack of modern film training facilities and the resulting weak production and technical resource quality of films is sometimes pretty low. There have been some efforts to develop film   training centres within Africa, most notably in Ghana and Burkina Faso, and to have not always succeeded in establishing uninterrupted training possibilities for Africa's cinema professionals

these circumstances , African film-makers have become increasingly dependent on training institutions abroad The main foreign cinema schools that have trained African film-makers are in Russia (Moscow Insti tute of Cinema) France   (particularly IDHEC and the gium However; too much dependence on foreign training can limit the freedom and independence of African flmmakers to develop their own approaches and attitudes to the medium

are no easier; even within Africa itself. International polistic interference has meant that Africans cannot see films made by fellow Africans as often as wish. The film markets are swamped by film products distributed by a few powerful foreign owned distribution companies, from America; Europe; and the Indian subcontinent. Persistent efforts have been made by African film-makers to break this rigid monopoly. In 1969, the Fédération Panafricaine des Cinéastes  (FEPACI), an Africa-wide organization, was created to challenge directly the existing distribution monopolies. Since then, a number of locally controlled regional and national cinema organizations have been established, which have had a small but important impact on the processes of cinema production and distribution in Africa. In have intervened by nationalizing cinema screening halls and products by African film-makers\_ they

Perhaps even more urgent is the need to improve on the competitiveness at home and abroad. There is no doubt that the scarcity of proper technical facilities and the acute lack of professionally trained production personnel

has greatly limited the capability of African film-makers

## FILM FESTIVALS

African film festivals held within and outside Africa have played a significant role in the promotion of the creative offered for best film have always created healthy competition resulting in the production ofmore quality films . The festivals are effective forums for dialogue between professionals involved in film production, on one hand, and between film-makers and those who Or watch their films on the other. are ideal platforms for the also of the marketability of African films, by encouraging intra-African trade as well as export opportunities buy They

THE SILENT ERA: 1900-1930

Up until 1930, when the first Iranian fiction feature flm was made, Iranian cinema was entirely dominated by the production of non-fction films. Before the First World War; most documentaries were sponsored and viewed by model of private; sponsored cinema. The films themselves were 'primitive' , consisting of footage of news events, actualities , and '~spectacles involving   royalty; usually filmed in long shot.

The first Iranian non-fiction footage was shot in Ostend, 'flower parade' of

cinema. He imported films from Europe and screened them in the backyard of his antique shop; and later, in November-December 1904, he opened short-lived commercial cinema in Tehran

Ethnic and religious minorities were instrumental in developing the nascent Iranian cinema In addition; number of the film pioneers were educated abroad and were connected to the ruling élite. Despite the rise of realm of the upper classes-in terms of both the content of the newsreels; and the sites of cinema screening. There are at least three chief reasons for the persistence of the private and sponsored cinema. The first has to do with the model set at the beginning, whereby the court or the government  sponsored film-makers who showed their films privately to the upper classes. State sponsorship of documentaries has continued in the present day Islamic Republic. The second reason was that the economic and technical infrastructures (such as labs , actingclasses, techto support an indigenous film industry had not yet developed \_ The third factor was the general social conditions and cultural attitudes which militated the growth of a local industry This included illiteracy, belief that film viewing led to moral COrruption; and religious taboos against cinema-going and strict censorship of imports were not uncommon\_ against for

## THE SOUND ERA: 1930-1960

By the early 1930s foreign sound newsreels (Paramount Metro, Movietone, Ufa, and Pathé) were playing in Iran. Iranian cinema benefited not only from the interand western education of its film-makers but also from exchanges with neighbouring countries first   Persian-language   sound newsreel\_ which was shown widely in Iran in 1932, was filmed by a Turkish photographer in Turkey. It showed the Iranian Kemal Ataturk and delivering a brief speech in Persian; and it astonished audiencesunaccustomed to hearing Persian spoken on the screen.

The first Persian-language sound feature, Dokhtare Lor hosain Sepenta and directed in India by Ardeshir Irani a melodramatic love story which also extolled and from his base in India Sepenta produce and export succession of films based on Iranian folktales and and theme, these films resembled the Indian popular genre of 'epicals'. The first Persian-language feature produced inside Iran, Tufan-e zendegi (The tempest of life') was directed by Esma'il Kushan in 1948\_ a more polished film, Zendani-e Amir ('Prisoner of the emir' , 1949). The success of Kushan's films produced at his Pars Film studio prompted liferation of new film studios. The growth of Iranian film production was also promoted by the stifing censorship Germany; 31 from France, and 19 from Britain. Censorship was imposed on films showing revolutions, riots, attitudes epics. from

The global ascendancy of the United States in the wake of the Second World War was to have profound impact on the development of the documentary film in Iran As part of the US policy to win the hearts and minds of nonbordered the Soviet Union, the United States Information Agency began an ambitious project of film screening production in these countries. Under its auspices, a group of American professors and film-makers (the Syracuse University team) visited Iran in the early 1950s to establish 16 mm documentary and educational films. They also developed (Iran were shown in public theatres throughout the country. and

## THE MODERN ERA: 1960-1978

The 1960s were tumultuous years Iran, bringing both the freedom which  petro-dollars and globalization of capital promised and the restrictions which actually produced in non-western countries The political solidation of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's regime involved the centralization and expansion of the state security apparatus (aided by the American CIA and the Israeli Mossad) and also the state's control over the film pean educated film-makers met with official disapproval and confiscation. For example, Farrokh Gaffary's Jonub-e Shahr ('South of the city' , 1958) which realistically and critically depicted life in the poverty-stricken southern for they

banned but also had its negative mutilated

Even more damaging to the indigenous film industry was the regime's desire to modernize along a western trajectory. This local ambition of the Shah and élite fitted the globalized interests of the US film and television media influences in Iran were thus replaced by global interests. American companies began selling all kinds of products and services, from feature films to television programmes , from TV receivers to TV studios, from communication expertise to personnel training; in short, sold not only consumer products but also consumer ideology. The development of the first television station in Iran provides an appropriate exampleThe station was established by Iraj Sabet, graduate in business adminRCA and Pepsi-Cola. American firms assisted in planning and implementation of the station which meant that, unlike many Third World countries , of broadcasting would not be non-commercial and state-run privately owned and commercially driven RCA technicians  trained the station's staff and agencies imported its programmes, the bulk of which consisted of MGM films and NBC TV series. In 1966 the government took over the Sabet station, consolidating its broadcasting but at the same time retaining the commercial structure Iran they but

At end, however; regional   influences remained strong in Iranian cinema. Egyptian and Indian melodramas and song-and-dance films were very popular with moviegoers , and thriving market for their songs ation. Record companies and radio stations, which promoted these songs, became part of a developing popular culture industry whose contents were highly influenced by western products.

At the end of the 1960s, the local film industry, which had been producing lowquality melodramas , comedies; was suddenly jolted by the release of two films which set a new trend, later called the New Wave. Mas'ud Kimia'i's Qaisar (1969) polished the luti genre by developing a strong binary opposition of bad guy and by linking the with Iranian tradition and culture and the bad with its violations (which in some circles was read as referring to the encroaching westernization and secularization) Thus, the tough guy genre's revenge usually involving defendkinswoman, was coded to be read as involving the defence of Iranian authenticity. Kimia'i also intensified the pacing ofthe genre by using an action-oriented filming style, dramatic camera angles; and stirring music. The other film that shook the local film industry and audiences alike was Dariush Mehrju'i's Gav ('The cow' , 1969), good good plot,

about a farmer who upon losing his cow, which is the source ofhis livelihood, begins toembody the cow in spirit and body. This film revived the social realist trend that Gaffary had begun over a decade before. Gav's focus on seen as return to roots, and its honest treatment of Iranian life and its sparse style, as breath by one of the leading contemporary writers, Gholamhosain Sa'edi, heralded new alliance between film-makers and writers. story

Gav also embodied contradiction that became the hallmark of the New Wave movement: it was sponsored by the state (Ministry of Culture and Art, MCA) and was censored and banned (for one year) by the state (the same visibility and critical acclaim which opened the way for government support of this type of cinema in the interest of gaining a positive international profile at the same time that it was criticized by an increasingly vociferous population ofIranian students abroad This uneasy alliance produced cession of important films: Davud Mowlapur' s Showhar-e Ahu husband' , 1966), Bahram Baiza'i's Ragbar ('Downpour 1970), and Mehrjui's Postchi The postman' , 1970) being

The films of the Wave gave impetus to, and were part of, a complex film culture which evolved between the Both the MCA and the National Iranian Television and Radio (NIRT) were established , and efiting from increasing national oil revenues. Both sup ported documentaries and fictional cinema and heavily sponsored and student-run university film clubs screened and discussed canonical films. Many festivals showcased and gave awards to local talent and exposed them to outstanding examples of foreign films, and the cultural arms of many foreign embassies also regularly exhibited important films from their countries. The Iranian government entered film-making through investment via staterun companies. This led to the production of some of the best films of the period: for example, The Institute for Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults produced such important shorts as Amir Naderi's Saze Dahani 'Harmonica' , 1973). as well as many of the finest animation films made in and Telfilm and the Film Industry Development Company produced many importNew benIran;

At the same time state-controlled   develop ments, the film culture of Iran was given boost by the emergence as collective force of group of trained film-makers , such as Hajir Dariush, Bahman FarGaffary; who began collaborations with respected anti-government writers, such as Sadeq foreign-

Sa'edi. The films produced moved away from traditional genres in favour of increased realism, individual character psychology; and higher technical quality. Film schools within Iran, and Super 8 film-production network (Cinemay-e AzadfFree Cinema), were established and trained many new film-makers Finally, an independent collective of New unhappy with state intervention in cinema formed the New Film bijan Still life' 1975) and Parviz Sayyad's Bonbast ('Dead they

Many New Wave films were also produced inde pendently or commercially, such as Baiza'i's Gharibeh va meh 'Stranger and the fog' 1975), but these were outnumbered by those supported by governmental and semigovernmental agencies. Despite such a remarkable flow of highquality films, the New Wave represented only small fraction offilms produced in Iran during this period. The majority of the forty-five to seventy films made each year were escapist and formulaic.

This not only jeopardized the financial health of the producers but also forced the directors to become timid in the issues tackled. Ironically; the emergence of New Wave films had an indirectly adverse effect on local film production in that it fragmented the audience\_ Tired of formula song-and-dance films, portion of the audience sought out the works of New Wave to strict censorship, were often unable to meet their expectations. Unsatisfied by the heavily compromised films or by the abstruse filmic laninvolvement in film-making added an extra level of competition and undermined the healthy growth of an indethey

turmoil that would lead to a social revolution was under way; a turmoil in which cinema was deeply implicated.

## POST-REVOLUTIONARY ERA: 1978-1994

Transition: 1978-1982

In the early days of revolution; cinema was condemned what was widely perceived to be its support of the Pahlavi regime's westernization projects. Traditionalists particularly accused cinema of becoming an agent of cultural colonization of Iran by the west, and it became favourite target of revolutionary wrath. In August 1978, nearly 400 spectators perished in a deliberate fire set in became an integral part of the dismantling of the Shah's regime. By the time the Islamic government was installed in 1979, 180 cinemas nation-wide had been destroyed, creatingshortage of exhibition sites from which Iranian cinema still suffers. As part of this purifcation process , imports were curtailed and those foreign films already in the country were reviewed with the overwhelming majority failing to live up to the evolving Islamist values of the 2,208 locally produced films reviewed, 1,956 were denied exhibition permits. Many films were made appropriate through strategic editing of scenes containing nudity or what was defined as immodesty: When cutting confused the narrative, the offensive body parts were blocked off with markers applied to each frame The screenplays for new films were also subjected to the same rigorous process, with only 25 per cent approved\_ Entertainers , actors, and film-makers were also subjected to 'purification' , involving legal charges, incarceration; censorship including barring of their faces, voices, and bodies from the screen.

The clerical leaders were not opposed to cinema per se; were Khomeini called its they against

'misuse' by the Pahlavi regime to corrupt and subjugate Iranians To ensure that it was used 'propcrly' , in June 1982 the cabinet approved a set of landmark regulations governing the exhibition of movies and videos and charged the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance (MCIG) with its enforcement. As before the revolution, political consolidation entailed consolidation of culture In 1983, the Ministry created Farabi Cinema Foundation to streamline and control the import and export of films and to encourage local production  Many regulations codifying 'Islamic values as well as encouraging pro duction of quality films were put into effect. The municipal tax for local films was reduced, ticket prices increased , importing equipment, film stock, and chemicals was calculated at the government-controlled exchange rate (instead of at the floating rate which was up to twenty times higher) and producers and exhibitors gained voice in assigning their films to theatres. AJl

these measures centralized the regulative and enforcementauthorities within the Ministry but also rationalized cinema, and in this period the number of films produced annually shot up almost threefold: in 1983 twenty-two features were produced, increasing to fifty-seven in 1986.

## Pains of maturity: 1987-1994

Women moved from the background of the stories and the shots into The restrictive filming grammar which curtailed their diegetic relations with men was   liberalized The averted gaze became more focused and direct, sometimes charged with sexual desires . More women directors of feature films emerged than in all the previous decades combined. Their best works include: Rakhshan Bani'etemad's Kharej az mahshandeh's Parandeh-ye kuchak-e khoshbakhti The little bird of happiness' , 1989), and Tahmineh Milani's Tazeh cheh khabar? ('What's new?' , 1992)

The commercial success of highquality films led banks to of the industry on a more secure financial footing: The MCIG put into place higher-quality films; were exhibited in higherclass theatres in prime seasons and for longer period-all of which enhanced their box-office receipts. The government also encouraged sync-sound filming by selling film-makers who chose this method a third more stock at the cheaper governmentcontrolled rate. This was designed to dialogue. Locally made films were aggressively entered in international festivals , many garnering praise, including Makhmalbaf's Arusi-ye Khuban Marriage of the upon a time cinema' , 1992) Sa'id Ebrahimian's Nar 0 ('Pomegranate and the reed' , 1988), Mas'ud Jafari Jozani's Dar cheshm-e tond-e bad In the wind's eye' 1988), Kimia'i's Dandan e mar Snake's 1990), Mehrju'i's Madreseh-e keh miraftim ('School we went to 1989) and Hamoun (1990), Kiarostami's Mashqe shab   ('Homework', 1988), Close-up (1990), and Zendegi va digar hich ('And life goes on', 1992), and Baiza'i's Mosaferan ('Travellers' , 1992) they Nay fang'

## India: Filming the\_Nation

In 1971 India overtook Japan to become the world's largest manufacturer of feature films, with a total of 431 titles. It had registered fairly steady growth through the 1960s, mark in 1979. In 1975 a Unesco survey on film audiences showed that it was the only Third World nation to have larger audience for indigenous cinema than for imported films. While foreign films remained relatively marginal to Motion Picture Export Association of America announced the Middle East, and the Far East (for example Malaysia) made it a cultural force equalling and sometimes outstripping Hollywood in these regions.

India declared itself a sovereign democratic republic in 1950 and almost immediately instituted a series of measures to intervene in the movie industry that had been booming ever since the war had ended. The first was

Nehru 's appointment of the S. K Patil Film Enquiry Comnew independent freelance investment sector that had replaced the old pre-war studios. 'During World War II; the Report observed:

the cinemagoing habit spread much further and faster among the population [following] a greater purchasing power among all variety of successors. Leading 'stars' exacting 'financiers and calculating distributors forged ahead. Film production, a combination of art, industry and showmanship, became in substantial measure the recourse of deluded aspirants to easy riches

There were at least three separate trends on which the Patil Committee was basing its views The first, its direct target of attack, was the new kind of money that was evolving policy on the kind of cinema it should back: this included its propaganda wing, Films Division, as well as the cinema of the nationalist left which saw itself as the legitimate claimant of state backing after Independence. And the third cultural   pan-nationalism, as represented by the Hindi cinema and replicated in region after region by a series of 'regional' production centres which sought the Hindi market while  simultaneously   extending the nationalist argument into a regionalist one, especially in south India.

By the mid-1950s, most of the major studios had closed down or transformed themselves into premises for hire: Prabhat, having never recovered from the loss of their premier   director; V Shantaram, made some panicky efforts to enter the Bombay mainstream with films like Yeshwant Pethkar's Badho (1947: future Hindi star Dev Anand's début) before it closed its shutters in 1953. [he New Theatres closed in 1955, while Bombay Talkies veritable film factories in the Filmistan and Vijaya studios ontrol on raw stock (imposed as 1943), and production leapt from 99 films in 1945 to 199 in 1946 and 280 films in 1947.The year 1947 also saw the founding of the Udaya studios in Kerala, the dominant producer of Malayalam films for decades to come The Vasan's Chandralekha hit the nega-hit made outside Bombay and Calcutta. The year 1949 saw the birth of the Tamil regionalist Dravida Munpeople, which used the support of studios like the AVM Film Company (started in 1947) to present a political argunent for novements like the Maha-Gujarat, Samyukta MahAage

arashtra, and Akhanda Karnataka andolans took hold and in many cases were the main cultural underpinning of the movie industry in the languages of Gujarati, Kannada, and Marathi.

## THE IPTA

Many of the contending ideologies that inform the Patil of them deal, at some level, with arguments around authenticity: realist rootedness versus indigenous mass culture, nationalist utopia versus the regionalist comhigh ground for setting the terms of the divide had effectively been appropriated by the influential Indian People's Theatre Communist Party-backed Progressive Writers Association, in the pre-war European anti-Fascist movements. Bijon Bhattacharya's play Nabanna (1944), a starkly realist documentary play staged by Sombhu Mitra and addressing the tragic Bengal famine that killed over 5 million people in 1943, launched the movement in radically new As the IPTA Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Punjab~its simultaneous commitment to localized people's art that merged with contemporary  political address, and an avant-garde internationalism that saw the first experiments with Brecht and Piscator (as in Utpal Dutt's theatre) found it well placed to handle both postwar and post-Independence attitudes to market commodification as well as to the new ideas of authorship that were now introduced in tandem with a state film policy lay

famous slogan 'People's Theatre Stars the People' The film merged Nabanna with a novel by Krishen Chander to tell story that became a virtual talisman for the nationalist realism to follow: the story of a family of Bengali migrants faithin a socialistfuture It was followed by Nemai Ghosh's seminal similar theme but a more sophisticated realism. Scripted with the informal assistance of Satyajit and featuring Ritwik Ghatak as actor and assistant director, the film's crucial sequence shot the family of East Bengal refugees amid documentary footage of the thousands of migrants sleepon Calcutta's Sealdah station. Hounded by official rough-edged  look sciously inscribed the extraordinarily difficult conditions Ray

The most important cinema, both formally and as political address, to come out of the IPTA was that of Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen. Ghatak's début Nagarik (The Citizen,

More spectacularly, in Kerala several former members of the Kerala People's Arts Club (KPAC: the local affiliate of the IPTA) provided the industry with film-makers like P.Bhaskaran and Ramu Kariat, composers like Devarajan; lyric writers like Vyalar Rama Varma; and writers like Thoppil Bhasi (author of the KPACs seminal play Ningalenne Communistaki (You Made Me Communist), 1952) and Poonkunnam Varkey. Most of these figures had

In Hindi, K A. Abbas led the way Sudhi Pradhan, author of the three-volume Marxist   Cultural   Movement in India (1979) speaks approvingly of Abbas's appointment as the IPTA's general secretary: 'In view of the political line the CPI was pursuing at the time he was admirably suited for the post, particularly when we had opted for the ised groups of dancing and drama. His contact with the film world in Bombay enabled us to project our image in Indian cinema.

In Awara, Kapoor plays the delegitimated son of a principled father; who has been raised by a bandit. He kills his foster father and nearly kills his real father as well, performing double Oedipal act that is presented as something like a rite of passage into adulthood, modernity; and independence.

Abbas's pioneering efforts were followed by Bimal Roy's of a farmer who is forced to move to the city: the farmer was played by Balraj Sahni and themusicwas composed by Salil Choudhury; both important figures from the IPTA's theatre. The Navketan production house started by Chetan with brothers Dev and Vijay Anand, then became dominant for the next two decades with musical melodramas and love stories that often demonstrated their moorings in postalong

Such an ideal of realism effectively became national cultural policy first with the founding of the Films Division, the documentary unit established in 1949 and the directly to enter filmmaking. Rooted in the war-propaganda featurettes of its predecessors, the Film Advisory Board and Information Films of India, and tracing thereby a link with the British documentary tradition of John Grierson and Basil Wright

In cinema, it was the IPTA's successful transition into a cinematic mainstream, rather than their early radical films that proved to be the movement's most enduring legacy Shantaram, Kapoor; Mehboob Khan, Navketan Bimal and Guru Dutt were all major producers and most of them went on to develop their own studios Or production concerns well into the 1960s, in context characterized by the end of classic studio production and the pinnacle of the Patil Report's fly-by-night operators: Roy,

## STATE POLICY

India came to defining for itself an identifiable mass culture of nationalism: an indigenous and self-sustaining economy offering a cultural product that served to explain and make comprehensible the traumatic experiences of Partition, the mass migrations with the formation of Pakand communal conflicts that ravaged almost every state of the merger of an erstwhile radical avant-garde with latter-day national policy: not least the extraordinarily effective way in which its realist melodramas reflected some of the key conflicts around Independence to use the paradigm for 'nation' to define community; as principles of social legitimization and enfranchisement. With the affirmation of the new IPTA, the mainstream Swadeshi mythologicals of a Phalke, which were earlier the repositories of 'Indianness came now to be placed in genre of realism, and a lexicon of images-of the village, 'real and thus more indigenously valid than other images being

## NEW INDIAN CINEMA

After Films Division, the second concrete film institution set up by the government was the Film Finance Corporation (1960), explicitly on the recommendation of the Patil Committee Report. For many years the sole funding alternative for independent Indian film-makers , its own chequered career; and its fluctua priorities, are a indication of the changing state attitudes to industry; and the enormous influence these wielded on the Indian cinema in general. When it was started it was under the Ministry of Finance and was explicitly intended to provide institutional finance 'or other facilities for the production of films of good standard' . In 1964 it underwent its first personality change, when it was shifted into the MinistryofInformation and Broadcasting, some feature films the best known Satyajit Ray's work (Charulata, 1964; Nayak, 1966; and Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne (The Adventures of and Bagha)  1968) tinggood have fifty being Goopy

As already noted, his origins in the IPTA (he was (Under the Blue Sky, 1958) and Baishey Shravan (The Wedding 1960) were largely melodramas within the IPTA's political referents (the anti-Fascism of the CPI following the directives the Communist International\_ the emphasis on rural activism and, the IPTA's leitmotif, the 1943 famine) In 1965 he claimed the influence of the French Nouvelle Vague in Akash Kusum (Up in the Clouds) and after 1970 made a series of Calcutta films, addressing as well as contributing to the Naxalite student movement, their future amid chronic unemployment and indiscriminate police brutality; and their anarchistic efforts to rewrite Bengal's and India's political history in the light of current conditions His films Interview (1970) and Calcutta '71 (1972) became political causes célèbres; the theatres New

His best-known films, Meghe Dhaka Tara (1960) Komal Gandhar (1961) and Subarnarckha (1962), a based in Calcutta and addressing the condition of hood, proved controversial and prevented him from making features for the next decade. In all three films, he used a basic and at times starkly realist story-line, upon which he inscribed a range of mythic references through a dense overlay of visual and aural registers Meghe Dhaka Tara centres on a working woman from refugee family who ends up sacrificing her freedom and eventually her life the survival of her family. Upon this story is overlaid reference to a Bengali legend about the goddess Durga: the legend defines the actual means by which women are oppressed and thereby be comes also the means of political recognition. The landscape and the highly discontinuous merging of natural sound, that of human labour, with a gradually evolving create virtually parallel texts to transform the realist story-line.

Like Kaul, Shahani too addressed the formal propositions of Indian aesthetic theory, but politicized it to greater extent with his use of the term Epic. Adapting the idea emphasizes the origins of the Epic in practice and tradition; and its crucial role in consolidating discourse of civilization (including under that head technologies and modes of production). His text in this has been the Mahabharata , which he adapted to make his biggest film, the melodrama Tarang (The Wave, 1984). Tarang; which tells the story of an industrial family riven with internal dissension; and that of working class equally trapped in its own selfdefinitions, consciously attempted to comment on the history of Indian nationalism through the tradition of melodrama that became its cultural counterpart.

In 1980, when Mrs Gandhi returned to power; much of her earlier socialism had been replaced by a free market ideology: the major front on which she started her new policy of economic liberalization was television. In 1981, the year India accepted a massive loan the International Monetary Fund and thus began its current crisis of extreme financial indebtedness, it also liberalized the import of colour TV sets, and set up the APPLE satellite\_ This, followed by the INSAT 1-B satellite in 1983, led to new era in Indian cultural 'politics: the Special Plan for Expansion ofTelevision was instituted, and forty-four new stations; and over 200 high- and low-power transponders, meant that geographically India could telecast to 70 per from

cent of its population. In 1985 Doordarshan offered this gigantic network to private-sector programming, especially appealing to the film industry to supply software, technical   personnel, and equipment for its new mercialized evening slots.

Since 1985, when the pro gramme was launched, television's domination has fundamentally affected the Indian film industry. Most of the New like  Benegal, moved to making TV films and TV serials, and several mainstream directors like Sholay's creator Ramesh (with the Mahabharata) done likewise The use of Doordarshan as publicity outlet-paralleling its unpre cedented effectiveness as an advertising medium-meant widespread formal change, as the Chitrahaar model (a programme stringing together song sequences from various films, and consistently the most popular genre on Indian TV in audience ratings) made it mandatory yet again that any major commercial success have at least one song hit. And this went along with the audiocassette revolution that saw (according to the Financial Times newsletter Music an astonishing fourteen-fold increase in record sales over just one year, from 1987 to 1988.

Perhaps the director who best exemplifies this trend is the most-discussed figure of recent Indian cinema, the Tamil film-maker Having   established himself, most unusually for a Tamil director; in a national market with Nayakan (Hero, 1987), a Kamalahasan crime movie based on The Godfather, he shifted into MTV-type rock video movies with Agni Nakshatram (1988) and Anjali (1990). Both films have extremely thin   plot-lines-the former features has middleclass family with handicapped child-but are packed with songs, shot with flare   lighting and diffused camera, and display an astonishing to replicate MTV editing with local references. Anjali was hit in the dubbed Hindi version as well, and the director was thus a noted national figure long before he made his most recent, and most controversial movie yet, Roja (1992) In this film; a newly married Tamilian hero is sent by the Islamic terrorists. In the context of the communal holoability

caust that has beset the country since the demolition of the Babri Masjid by Hindu fundamentalist mobs in 1992, this theme was topical to say the least. A westernized hero whose Hinduism is inscribed into all his behaviour from his marriage to a rural belle, to his 'patriotism as captive; was contrasted with a bunch of obviously Muslim and anti-Indian terrorists. The film, advertised as a 'patriotic love story' became one of the biggest hits of the year in both its original Tamil and its dubbed Hindi versions This unprecedented success was due in equal measure to its politics, in which respect it belongs toa bunch ofrecent hits all feeding off recent 'Hindutva' militancy and to its innovative use of music-notably its rap number 'Rukmini' with a chorus line of middle-aged Tamil matrons.

In the heyday of Indian cinema, many of the otherwise crass and deplorable forms of cinematic mass culture have stood the nation in stead by rigidly maintaining the equation between nationalism and 'belonging' and by locating the nation as secular multi-cultural entity in opposition to the divisive challenge from the Hindu right. Even when promoting regional difference and even separatism, previous Indian cinema never set these differences ata religious-communitarian level. Two dangerous trends threaten the Indian cinema: one is political-commercial and stems from the compromises made with televisual neoimperialism; and the other is more narrowly political and communitarian, deriving from the shattering of the it is the one more to be feared. good

## Indonesian Cinema

In 1993 Indonesia had a total population of 186 million people made up of 300 ethnic groups (with over 300 languages and dialects) spread across the 13,000 islands that make up the Indonesian archipelago. The main population centre is the island of Java with over 100 million people: With the breakup of the Soviet Union, Indonesia became the world's fourth most populous nation

a small number of films were made in the Netherlands East Indies. About 110 films were produced between 1926 and 1950,mainly by Chinese companies, but also by the Dutch colonialists. An indigenous Indonesian cinema only began in earnest in the first year ofindependence from the Dutch in 1950.In the following decade, Indonesia produced an average of thirty-five features a year, mostly made in Jakarta, the national capital, in the national language, Bahasa Indonesia, language similar to Malay.

## MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE 19505 AND 19605

The growth of Indonesian cinema after 1950 was led by the pioneering director Usmar Ismail, who made more than twenty-five films before his death in 1971. Usmar's first post-independence productions-Darah dan doa' ('The march' , 1950), Enam djam di Djogdja ('6 hours inJogja', 1951) and Lewat djam malam ('After the curfew 1954)all celebrate the years of struggle for independence; but as post-revolutionary productions have an unusual   scep ticism, the very opposite of what was found in the Soviet Union in the 1920s. Instead, these films highlight, with a quiet understatement and considerable  subtlety; the moral ambiguities produced by the revolutionary period. His most successful film, Krisis, now lost, was comedy about the housing crisis in the early years of the republic; andin 1955 he made a brilliantand prophetic satire on the dangers of charismatic political leadership in Indonesia agung 'Exalted guest') which was released despite its implicit criticism of President Sukarno long Tamu

The events of 30 Sep tember 1965,in which some leftist elements in the army massacred six leading army generals; resulted in the annihilation of the left in Indonesia and the emergence of a right-wing, military-backed government; known as the New Order; led by General Suharto, who remained in power for over three decades. Most of the films that had been made by left-wing directors such as Bachtiar Siagian and Basoeki Effendi were lost at this time, though some on American imports and prioritized the emergence of a highly commercial indigenous cinema, which began to take off in the early 1970s

Usmar's production company Perfini, provided a framework for the emergence of a number of other talented young directors. Most notably it supported Djayakusuma, who was interested in traditional cultures and regional diversity He explored these issuesin his 1953 film Harimau Tjampa ('The tiger from Tjampa') which centred on the Islamic philosophies of restraint that underlie it.

Other significant writer-directors to emerge under the Perfini umbrella were Asrul Sani-who was also noted and Nya Abbas Akup's Tiga buronan ('Three fugitives 1957) was story about three bandits harassing the citizens of quiet Islamic village. With a mild and easy wit, the film mixed the humour and style of lenong Betawi (a form of lyrical subversive theatre that evolved in the nineteenth century under Dutch colonial with plot and visual style that also bear traces of the Hollywood Western, mocking gentle Indonesian way some of the conventions of Hollywood.

In the early 1970s a new generation of talent emerged in the Indonesian cinema. Most notable were the Moscowscripts in 1956, and Teguh Karya; whose collective proved to be an important training ground for new talent over the following twenty-five years. It was from Teguh's collective that director Slamet Rahardjo and multi-award-winning actress and entrepreneur Christine Hakim emerged.

In the 1970s Teguh Karya his collective by alternating   production popular commercial films-establishing major stars on the way-and special projects, such as his great historical film November 1828 (1979).

## POPULAR CINEMA IN THE 19705 AND 19805

One of the strengths of the popular Indonesian cinema has been the way in which it has evolved several distinct genres that are not found in any other society in quite the popular stars was the 'Betawi comedian and singer Benyamin S. who in string of films made very quickly and cheaply\_Raja Lenong of   Lenong') Benyamin jatuh cinta Tarzan pensiunan ( Tarzan pensioned off ') developed what amounted to critique of modernization.

Developed jointly with Elvy Sukaesih, it was very consciously given a further Islamic dimension by Rhoma Irama, in an attempt to discover an 'Eastern style. Irama was banned from television for ten years because he espoused certain Islamic positions antithetical to the state out in these films are often rudimentary but the power of their music made them extremely popular; particularly among the pOOr.

THE REVOLUTIONARY CINEMA 1949-1956: politics and industry

After 1949, production, distribution, exhibition, and censorship of films fell under the purview of the Ministry of Propaganda and, later; the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture. Beginning in 1951, movies from Shanghai made before 1949 were banned; as were those from Hollywood and Hong In for and about workers, peasants , and soldiers (gongnongbing dianying) were shown, to support socialist reconstruction of the country. With Soviet assistance, the   industry soon achieved technological self-sufficiency: By 1959 ten an animation studio had been built in the major cities; and in the late 1950s small provincial studios also producing newsreels and science education shorts began

National distribution of films was undertaken by the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Company which operated through provincial, city; and county offices. The Film Bureau also set up more exhibition units for the masses: from theatres in exhibition units increased up to 20,363 in 1965, with 13,997 projection teams which serviced peasants in the countryside with 16 mm. projectors and slide projectors.

Hence, narrative and formal strategies used in traditional drama and literature, and in Soviet and Hollywood films of the 1930s and 1940s, often appeared together in orthodox versions of revolutionary history and The filmmakers adherence to China's own theatrical and literary traditions was also revealed in their creation of 'opera film' and 'literary adaptations' (of modern Chinese literature) as new genres . prinkey they

From 1949 to 1950 the Northeast Studio produced about eighteen low-budget black and white films which were early models portrayed heroic figures and memorable episodes of the revolution; several of which, such as Daughters of China (Zhonghua nuer, 1949), The White-Haired Girl  (Baimaonu, 1950), and Zhao Yiman (1950), told moving stories of women as fighters, as hagiography enhanced the popular appeal of female figures of liberation and struggle.

The political criticisms of the output of the private studios focused on the film The Life of Wu Xun (Wu Xun zhuan, 1950), directed by Sun Yu. The film depicted a self made educator who initially set up schools by literally begging on the streets\_ In campaign which years later; in 1985, was officially denounced as 'partial, extreme and violent' , it was accused of having misrepresented bouras proletarian revolution and thus committed a grave political mistake Following Mao Zedong's criticism of The Life of Wu Xun, the film circle underwent re-education and Film Steering Committee was formed to censor scripts in a detailed manner: The harsh criticism launched against a single film not only ensured the Party's control over artists' interpretation of history and culture but also enabled the Yan'an faction to ride over veteran artists of Shanghai.

After the Communist take over; the private studios that remained in Shanghai, including Kunlun\_ Wenhua, the transitional   period. Between 1949 and 1951 produced approximately forty-seven films; but soon ran into political difficulties, as result of which gradually disbanded and were incorporated into an expanded Shanghai Film Studio in 1953. they they they

Standardization of administrative and censorship cedures took place in 1953.

1956-1959: the 'Hundred Flowers' and Anti-Rightist periods In 1956 Mao Zedong launched the policy to 'Let Hundred Flowers   Bloom and Hundred Schools of Thought Contend 'Baihua qifang, baijia zhengming' The film circle responded eagerly to the climate of openness by hinting at the negative impact of political pressures on film-making.

Connections with Europe were strengthened during this period as fivemember delegation attended the Cannes festival and visited Italy; England, and Yugoslavia to observe local productions. At home, Italian neo-realist films were shown in major cities; and studied by filmmakers. Urban movie-goers were to see prO gressive films from Italy, Japan, India, and Mexico-

Thesearch for connections between film and traditional opera, folk music, and literature also began. Discourse on the nationalization of film (dianying minzuhua) underscored the cultural basis of revolutionary realism. Affirm ing the need to produce 'films with Chinese flavour was a recognition ofthe tastes of Chinese artists and audiences and indicated growing   independence from Soviet

models of merging the traditional arts and Marxist-Leninist world-view were explored, exemplified by two early colour films: Liang Shanbo and Zhuyingtai (1954) an opera film based on traditional love story, and New Year's Sacrifice (Zhufu, 1956) adapted by Xia Yan from Lu Xun's novella of the same name Ways

In the ofinnovation, a number of films were made with anti-bureaucratic content. The satirical comedies of Lu Ban were sharpest in their criticisms: Before the New Director Arrives (Xinjuzhang daolai zhiqian, 1956) exposed the hierarchical rela tionship existing among cadres , and the three episodes in The Unfinished Comedy (Weiwancheng de matists.

introduced Changchun studios. While the censorship system remained intact, the importance of the director was recognized in these units, which had more autonomy in selecting scripts and personnel, in budgeting and ensuring boxoffice returns. The Shanghai Studio branched into three substudios: Jiangnan, Tianma, and Haiyen, each containing two or three director-centred production units.

Then, in August 1957, the Anti-Rightist movement hit the film circle. large number of writers and film directors were designated as 'rightists' , and publicly attacked for spreading 'bourgeois thinking' . Lu's Unfinished Comedy was labelled a 'poisonous weed' , and Lu was never allowed to direct again. The Anti-Rightist movement moved to new stage in April 1958,when (later tobecome one of the Gang of Four) identified a number of films as 'white that were against the spirit of workerAll in all twenty-four films made and banned from circulation Kang Sheng flags'

In the two years following the Anti-Rightist movement, two major developments stimulated film output without the repressive climate: in 1958, the national Great Forward movement called for more films; in 1959, the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the PRC, better productions were demanded.

The tenth anniversary of the PRC encouraged betterquality productions that celebrated the Party's achievements While focusing on China's modern history; these films all shared an appealing human focus: Cui Wei and Chen Huaikai's of Youth (Qingchun zhige) traced the trials and triumphs of ayoung woman who was suffocated by the genteel Fourth culture and ultimately found real liberation through participating in the Communist movement. Lin Zexu portrayed Commissioner Lin Zexu's anti-imperialist efforts during the Opium War. The film was meticulous in the recreation of period details; and its broad historical background was complemented by scenes that   captured Lin's private moments. Yan's Our in the Battlefield disguised as a male soldier who had to withdraw from the army after her sexual identity was revealed These films stood out as capable works that successfully merged tics and art. Although box-office records were routinely boosted by   bulkbuying from work units  using state money; the 1959 record high of 4.17 billion annual movie attendance indicated that, after decade's efforts, revolutionary cinema had earned a national audience base.

The most famous operas were: Taking Mountain by Strategy (Zhiqu Weihushan; 1970) directed by Xie Tieli; The Red Lantern (Hong Dengji, 1970) by Cheng Yin; The WhiteHu; and Red Detachand Fu Jie. The latter two were based on feature films of the same names made in 1950 and 1960, but in these new versions, the growth processes of the protagonists were eliminated oines the very beginning. These productions formed a genre of their own; a stage hybrid, characterized by dense colours , takes, and a approach in the visual presentation of class heroes and their enemies.

## AFTER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION

1977-1984: 'wound' or 'scar' films

In 1977 the Gang of Four's accusations were officially refuted and the rehabilitation of film-makers was accompanied by the exhibition of the once-condemned About fifty feature films, mostly anti-Gang of 1977 and 1978 , to the audiences cadres and workers struggling together against the Gang's allies in an arms factory; was in circulation for fifteen months with attendances reaching 67 million. These antiGang films were, however, as schematic and clichéd in their approach as the pro-Gang ones; and soon lost their audience Four they

Most of the films that were adapted from 'wound' Or 'scar' literature were produced before 1983. focused mainly on the disruption of relationships and careers by unjustified persecution before and during the Cultural Revolution. rative devices, and overall , melodramatic and poetic approaches replaced didactic ones. These films were quite outspoken about political and 're-humanization was their goal. For example, Yang Yanjin and Deng Yimin's Troubled Laughter (Kunaoren de xiao, 1979) centred on journalist's frustration with bureaucratic pressure Wu Yigong's Evening Rain (Bashan yeyu, 1980) contrasted the unsympathetic Red Guard with the human warmth of the common people, and Xie Jin's melodramatic Legend of the Tianyun Mountain (Tianyunshan chuanqi, 1980) presented relentless picture of an intellectual's sufferings during the Anti-Rightist movement, recalled by a young woman who was pressured to jilt him for political reasons The sanctioned these stark revelations of political persecutions; Evening Rain and Legend of the Tianyun Mountain won the first official Golden Rooster award in 1981, decided upon by a panel ofofficials and critics The films of this period also saw a conscious redefinition of character types in that no longer eulogized peasants at the expense of intellectuals Wang Qimin and Sun Yu's At Middle Age (Rendao zhongnian, 1982) bemoaned the physical and mental exhaustion ofa dedicated woman doctor; and Wu Tianming's River without Buoys (Meiyou hang; biao de heliu, 1983) dramatized workers' indifference to the 'model operas' Overall, however; the genre of 'wound'scar' films had run its course by 1984, as the imagination of writers and directors was captured by China's modernization They They Party they

After 1973 feature film production slowly resumed, as film professionals returned from workcamps. Between 1973 and 1976 about eighty films were made, with the Changchun, Beijing, and Shanghai studios bearing most of the production load. Several classical opera films were adapted from folklore for their safe and presumably apo litical character, but many of them remained unreleased Inevitably; stylistic inflections of 'revolutionary model strictly follow Jiang Qing's 'three prominences' principle were Chun Miao and Li Wenhua's Breaking with Old Ideas (Juelie) which allegorized the Gang's political opponents within the Party as 'bourgeois' characters .

The question of whether he is a sympathetic rebel OI ruthless opportunist remains open, as a triangular love relationship shows him ready to abandon his attachments in the countryside and leave the village through In a similar spirit of youthful rebelliousness , the inquisitive high-school to accept her teacher's unreasonable chastisement. The delightful interplay of colours in this film invoked a new generation's innocence and vitality. In the early years of economic reform, engaging in private enterprise became legitimate means of changing one's destiny; and this became the subject of many films of the period. Young entrepreneurs often felt isolated, as the sewing woman experienced in Chen Beichen's Under the Bridge (Daqiao xiamian); small businesses could rise and fall quickly, as the unemployed youths in southern China find out in Zhang Liang' caused enile disciplinary centres as actors to depict an aspect of Chinese society that had never appeared on film before. In many of the popular films of 1984, the thematic affirmation of individual desires was reinforced by a formal independence from generic conventions, and the pursuit ofa more 'natural' style. village

new relationship between the PartylState, industry; and the audience also began to take shape in the early 1980s caused by the policy of incorporating the market economy into the planned economy. The state withdrew financial backing for all but a few productions and each studio was required to balance its own annual

budget. Audiences' tastes gained a new status. Until 1993, however; box office receipts were still only indirectly connected to studio profit, since distribution of films was monopolized by the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Company (CFDEC) whose local   representatives would order a certain number of exhibition prints based on an estimation of a film's popularity and sometimes on decisions from another district. This practicehad provided a financial buffer for studios in the years when prints were bought mostly on the basis of edifying needs. However; as both CFDECs branch offices and local theatres had to balance their own budgets while annual movie attendance fell steadily from 1984, many films did not recoup their production costs as the selling of prints  was no longer guaranteed. The conversion to an audience based film market stimulated the massive production of entertainment movies, which hastened the demise of politically didactic films However, the increasingly competitive entertainment market also proved to be detrimental to the formal experiments begun in the early 1980s.

## The Fifth Generation

Until One and Eight ( he appeared in 1984, attempts to modernize film language did not go beyond that of humanist Director  Zhang Junzhao cine Beijing Film Academy, shocked everyone with the unprecedented handling of filmic space (specifically; close-ups and off-screen space to create tension between characters) . sparse and highly elliptical dialogue; as well as the cre ation of a masculinity so far absent from China's screens The film has an unusual story involving a chain-gang of prisoners held by Communists during the anti-Japanese war. Many changes had to be made before the film passed the censors, and it remained unreleased for quite some time

In the same year, Chen Kaige, also 1982 graduate of the Academy; made Yellow Earth (Huang tudi) with Zhang Yimou as the cinematographer. The film impressed local critics but was considered too obscure by officials. It was not until Yellow Earth was shown at the Hong Kong International Film Festival and received praise   from enthusiastic critics and audiences that its exceptional quality was properly acknowledged. Yellow Earth remained a seminal film with its critical insight into China's contemporary political culture through deceptively simple story with sparse dialogue;   involving four   symbolic Yellow River were created with cinematographic style which, like that of austereyet rich in meaning; while local tunes underscored the film's ethnographic aspects again

Tian Zhuangzhuang, classmate of Zhang and Chen, made On the Hunting Ground (Liechang zhasa, 1985) and Horse Thief (Daoma zei\_ 1986), situating his stories among the dignified Mongolians, and obliquely expressing disdain for the dominant Han nationality and their ethnocentrism. His films caused noted documentarist Joris Ivens to declare that 'Chinese film has great hope' but since they were thought to be too obscure for the Chinese audience, very few exhibition prints were bought by the distribution agents . King

The young Academy graduates shared the experience of marginalization, exile from urban centres, and hardship during their adolescent years because of the Cultural Revolution; and they had no reservations in publicly expresstheir disillusionment with their country More importantly, the Fifth Generation movement enforced rupture between itself and the types of realism established. In relentlessly dismantling the language and eration films renounced the dramatic patterns of both revolutionary and humanist realism; instead, their narrative and formal strategies were critique oriented. In short, the Fifth Generation films refused to be appeased ing

Though similar neither in theme Or style, the exper imental works by these young directors were identified by critics as 'exploratory films and their makers as 'Fifth Generation directors The term 'exploratory' (tansuo) refers to an unprecedented use of modern film language, as well as an uncompromisingly criticaloutlook that later

was regarded as too élitist, especially since many of these in their home while   winning awards at international festivalsThe Fifth Generation label acknowledged the previous generations' contribution to the development of Chinese film.

with the official announcement of the coming of a 'new' era.

As mavericks, the Fifth Generation directors were far being homogeneous in their output: Wu Ziniu's The Last Day of Winter (Zuihou yige dongri, 1986) centred on prison labour-camp in the north-western desert; Hu Mei's young woman's feelings in a story of repressed love; Huang Jianxin's Black Cannon Incident (Heipao shijian, 1985) was black comedy which exposed the debilitating aspects ofChina's political culture, and his Dislocation (Cuo wei, 1987) was sciencefiction fantasy; Zhou Xiaowen's In their Prime (Tamen nianqing, 1986) staged scenes of the Sino-Vietnamese war to expose its bleak and tragic aspects; and Zhang Zeming's Swan (Jue xiang, 1985) traced the disappointments and betrayals in the life of a Cantonese musician. Though not considered Fifth Generation director; Huang Jianzhong contributed towards the movement with his surrealistic experiment Questions for the Living (Yige shizhe dui shengzhe de fangwen, 1986). from Song

While tragedy and satire had been largely absent from the didactic films of the classical revolutionary period, tragedy, absurdity; and ambiguity made their return in the Fifth Generation films, which consciously steered away from the established generic conventions. Though embraced by young critics in Shanghai and Beijing who admired their 'exploratory' path, from 1987 the Fifth Generation film-makers were subjected to increasing commercial pressure and criticism

The mid-1980s saw theemergence of Zhang Yimou, from cinematographer to award-winning actor and Though Fifth Generation member, Zhang cultivated more sensuous and popular style than many of his classmates, and his stories of desire were captivating for their legendary and mythic dimensions. His art films' accessibility both internationally and locally marked the beginof the end of the more austere and difficult 'exploratory films' . ning

## The Fourth Generation

'Fourth Generation' directors were more humanist in outlook than their younger counterparts, and thus were more accepted, even though they were as ambitious as the Fifth Generation in redefining China's filmic conventions. Given the label soon after the term Fifth Generation appeared the Fourth Generation refers to those directors who completed their professional training before 1966. and whose careers were suspended by the Cultural Revolution. While diverse in subject and style, several of their films of the mid-1980s shared matic concern with the conflicts and frustrations arising from an individual's attempts to break with the estab lished system. Huang Jianzhong's A Good Woman (Liangjia funu, 1985) incorporated Freudian imageryin its depiction

of the desires of a young woman who is married to a child husband, and has an affair with a farm labourer. Xie Fei and Wu Lan's Girl from Hunan (Xiangnu xiaoxiao; 1986) had a similar story but focused on the repression and internalization of feudal ideologies; which enabled such unreasonable arrangements to perpetuate\_ Yan Xueshu's In the Wild Mountains (Ye shan, 1985), winner of the year's Golden Rooster award, traced the changes between two peasant couples as one of them responds to the opporConcerns with peasants encountering a different economic climate was also broached by Hu Binliu's Country Folk (Xiang min, 1986), whose trilogies (which included Call of the Home Village and Country Couple) thematized the clash of village's desperate search for water and the sacrifices made by young peasant who returned from the city to help the has a redemptive value, as it is expressive of individuality and desire to change. village village

The rise of Xi'an Film Studio to national prominence from the mid-1980s helped to develop the 'exploratory film movement. Under the leadershipofdirector Wu Tianhits like Magic Braid (Shen bian, 1986), and sponsored experimental works by the Fifth Generation Wu undertook political and financial risks by producing The Black Cannon Incident, Horse Thief, In their Prime, and of was wonderfully realized when Yimou's Red Sorghum (Hong gaoliang, 1987) won the Golden Bear in the 1988 Berlin Film Festival and drew large local audience as the result of its international reputation. Arguably, Wu's prolonged stay in the United States after 1989 also contributed to the demise of the 'exploratory film movement. King Zhang

By the late 1980s, it was quite obvious that socialism had become an empty signifier for most members of the Communist Party, especially since those that benefited first and foremost from economic reform were high officials and their families.

## Women directors

During the 1980s, approximately twenty women directors made their first features, and many remained active in the early 1990s to establish themselves in working environment still dominated by men, where male directors had for years appropriated the paradigm of female victimization for their own critical discourse, where feminism was rejected as 'foreign' , and female leadership was associated with the cinema' gradually emerged, which articulated female sub jectivity and desire against social pressures to conform to her poetic and subtle approach in Shao (1983), Sacrificed Youth, and Good Morning   Beijing. Woman Demon Human (Ren qing, 1988) was based on the life-story of a contemporary opera who played the to reveal the tension between a woman's familial experience and her artistic career. Her next film, Huahun (1993) of the 1910s, was heavily censored for its scenes of nudity. Wang Junzheng's First Woman in the Forest (Shanlinzhong touyige nuren, 1987) and Woman Taxi Woman (Nuren taxi nuren, 1991) depicted vital and sexually active women who were resourceful partners and companions.

Among the more elderly female directors, Wang Haowei was dediing Fascinating Musical Band (Miren de yuedui, 1985) and were especially welcomed by the government. By the early 1990s, however, many women directors could only find work in entertainment and action genre movies

After Tiananmen: commercial cinema vs. the underground In the two years after the Tiananmen Massacre of 1989 personnel changes in the government reflected the triumph of conservative factions An 'anti-bourgeois lib eralization' campaign result. Meanwhile, studios kept churning out relentlessly commercial products, as they faced a host of worries: shrinking annual movie attendance;   increasing pro duction costs; competition from western and Hong Kong movies on video; and the popularity of home musical entertainment and karaoke singing outlets.

In this climate the state financed aiming to salvage the CCP's declining reputation.

The history of Hong Kong cinema after the

World War can be divided into threedistinct periods From 1946 to 1970, the socalled classical period\_ the majority of both Mandarin (the official Chinese language) and Cantonese (thelocal dialect) film production was studio-based. An entertainment oriented cinema developed, which opened its arms to Japan. At the same time, local and overseas distribution networks were established, which have continued their operations to the present Then in 1971 Hong Kong transition period with the demise of Cantonese cinema. This period was marked by the dominance of kung-fu films, and the gradual formation of local film culture, with Cantonese slowly reasserting itself as the language in local films. In 1979 Hong Kong cinema entered the modern period; a new generation took over, both behind and in front of the camera, and freed film production from the studio sound stages. As production qualities and marketing skills improved to international standards Hong Kong to attract international attention and acclaimgenre day.

## THE CLASSICAL PERIOD

## Mandarin cinema

Although the films produced in Hong Kong in the 1930s were overwhelmingly in Cantonese; the most significant phenomenon in Hong Kong cinema after the Second World War was the large influx of film workers from Shanghai and the rise of a Mandarin film The majority of film-makers who migrated to Hong Kong after 1946 were already established names in the Shanghai film industry Many had worked for the Japanese-controlled Huaying Studio during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and were in danger of blackby colleagues in the industry or prompted by fear of persecution, went into voluntary exile in Hong Kong: 'being they

The founding of the Hwa (Yonghua) Company by the Shanghai mogul Li Zuyong in 1947 further attracted as China was torn by civil modern film-making facilities, Li to studio that would equal surpass the greatness of Lianhua and Mongxing in pre-war Shanghai. The plan was to produce Mandarin films in Hong Kong and distribute them on the Chinese mainland. The company's first 'milliondollar spectacle' , Soul of China (Guohun, Bu Wancang, 1948), was a box office success. Efforts were even made to sell expensive historical epics to western markets; and Sorrows of the at the Locarno Film Festival in 1950 to great critical acclaim\_ However, Li underestimated the with company became inactive with Yung aspired speed huge

tural chauvinism, expecting an early recovery of the mainland by the Nationalist government. This was reflected in their films Even when dealing with realist subjectmatters, the Hong settings looked more like Shang; hai, and the style and content of the films often evoked (or even directly remade) Shanghai films from before 1949 . Kong

in Hong Kong could not survive withoutthe Taiwanese market. However; the Kuomintang government was ization which became known as the 'Hong Kowloon Film and Drama Free Association' (Gangliu dianying xiju shiye ziyou zonghui). Only films made by members of the Association could be shown in Taiwan\_ and so almost all the independent companies in Hong Kong came under the influence of the Taiwanese government Kong -

For Mandarin cinema to take root in Cantonesespeaking community; it had to expand its market and enlarge its audience base. The nostalgia of many northern immigrants for their homeland provided a loyal audience in Hong Kong. There was also an expansion into the Taiwanese market. Taiwan had been ceded to Japan in 1895, and in the following fifty years imported Japanese films dominated the market. When the Second World War ended and the Nationalist   (Kuomintang)   government moved to Taiwan, the influx of mainland immigrants pro vided an audience base, and Hong Kong became the natural supplier of Chinese films.

During the late 1940s, even the strongest independents had not been able to challenge the power of Yung Hwa, but in the early 1950s the strength of the independents grew. The most important were Xinhua under  Zhang Shankun and Taishan under Bu Wancang. The only independents that maintained a distance from the Taiwanese Association were those which were that is financially supported by the Communist Chinese government. The largest of these was the Great Wall 1950, joined together with two smaller 'left-wing' sister of Zhu Shilin, and trained new generation of filmmakers

Melodrama; which bore the memory of suffering in the war years, became the mainstream genre. However, all the films even the comedies, produced by these 'left-wing' and independent studios were didactic; preaching antifeudalism, quasi-feminist view on the sufferings of women, and even Marxist ideology of class struggle.

The early 1950s saw the rise of powerful socially conscious films.It was the immigrants unbending nationalist sentiments that led them to support these productions Untouched by the Hollywood tradition of escapist enterof 1930s Shanghai cinema was revived in Hong Kong, as economic recession hit in the wake of the Korean War and trade embargoes on China. The notable examples are Flower Girl by Zhu Shilin

From the mid-1950s onwards, as the northern immigrants realized that their state of exile would be permanent, and younger generation of Hong Kong flmmakers came of age (the most prominent Tao Qin and Li Hanxiang) Mandarin cinema became more intemore concerned with appeared The Hollywood-influenced youth musical Mambo Girl (Manbo nulang, Yi Wen, 1957), which charts the heroine's search for her long-lost mother and her final return to her foster parents, can be read as the Shanghai director's love letter to Hong Kong. being and

Catering to working-class audience with little education, the majority of Cantonese films chose character stereotypes and colloquial language (exploiting the dialect's complex tones and abundant whimsical slang) as their backbone instead of refined visual design. Plots were generally culled from opera stories, folklore, and popular anecdote. The most popular genres throughout the 1950s were Cantonese opera (e.g.Li Tie's The Purple Hairpin (Zichai ji, 1959), already a cult classic) martial arts films (such as the Huang Fei-hong series starring Kwan Takhing in seventy-five films from 1949 to 1970), comedies, and melo drama

## Cantonese cinema

Despite the gradual integration of Mandarin cinema into Hong Kong culture, the basic fact remained that the majority of the immigrant population arriving in Hong Kong after 1949 came and about 80 per cent of the Cantonese\_ These immigrants needed inexpensive entertainment, and as Canfamiliar world and naturally became loyal sup porters. Between 1946 and 1969, the total output of Cantonese films approximated 3,500 titles, more than three from

This prodigious output, however; led to a sharp decline in the quality of the films produced; were shoddy material dubbed 'seven-day wonders In 1952, in response to this crisis nineteen concerned directors , producers , actors, and actresses founded Union Films Enterprises Ltd.

## The 1960s: new audiences; new films

The flourishing Cantonese film industry reached its in 1960 when over 200 films were produced. Demographic changes largely accounted for this; the baby-boom generation, now approaching late adolescence; significantly boosted the size of the film-going public. Hong Kong itself was in the process of transforming itself from comsition provided   cinema with many new themes and subject-matters peak

The new teenage audience led to the popularity of teen idols Chen Baozhu and Xiao Fangfang.

The output ofCantonese cinema took a downward turn in the late 1960s, and the decade ended with only twenty-two films Soon afterwards production ground to a virtual standstill.

The Guangyi Film Company, managed by director Qin Jian, was perhaps most adaptive to these changes. From a staple of literary adaptations in the 1950s, the company quickly switched to urban comedies. Despite some successes , the modernization and westernization of Cantonese films ultimately failed. No matter how modern and stylish their décor and characters tried to be, the outlook been properly digested and integrated into local culture.

## THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD

While Cantonese film-makers struggled to pace with the times, Mandarin cinema began to turn its weakness into advantage Shanghai, Mandarin films had once been too urbane for the Cantonese population, but in the 1970s it was precisely these qualities which became appealing. When Mandarin action-packed martial arts films   began   flooding the keep

The new dominance of Mandarin cinema would not have been possible without two big corporations: the Motion Picture & General Investment (Dianmou) Company; and Shaw Brothers (Shaoshi) MP & GI had been founded in 1956, from the Singapore-based Ca Organization (Guotai) which itself had bought the bankrupt Yung Hwa studio. The Shaw family had started film production in Shanghai as early as the 1920s, but had moved to Hong Kong during the SinoJapanese War. were the frst company to move into distribution in Singapore and Malaysia, and reorganized in 1957 to challenge MP & GI huge studio complex, had been constructed in Clearwater and during its peak years Shaws boasted a staff of over 1,000, including 20 directors and 140 actors actresses , and an annual film production of 40 to 50 features. thay They Bay, and

For several years, Shaw and MP & GI were locked in projects by filming the same stories. But after the defection of many of MP & GI's directors and stars to Shaw Brothers in the early 1960s, the latter took control of the market while the former suffered

Both companies made films in many genres. MP & GI was famous for its comedies, especially those scripted by the famous writers Eileen and well as its romantic dramas. It also pioneered Chinese musical extravaganzas and its first colour film Calendar Chang

The new-style martial arts film also had an important impact on fact, the 1960s were Taiwan cinema's golden era as number of martial arts films and romantic dramas adapted from the popular writer Quiongyao were successfully exported to the Hong market, changing the direction of film trade from one-way to two-way. large Kong

Although huangmei opera films were popular and even Cantonese audiences were captivated by their glamorous spectacles, it was the new-style martial arts film that dealt the fatal blow. In 1967, Cheh's One-Armed Swordsman (Dubei dao) set new boxHu grossed HKS2 million with his Taiwan  production Dragon Gate   Inn (Longmen kezhan)   Fast-paced and sensational the films excelled in an exuberant style of combat borrowed from Japanese samurai films and married to the Chinese martial arts tradition  It proved to be admirably suited to the needs of a rapidly developing Hong Chang King

This process started in 1963 after the huge success of thers to form his own company; Guolian, with him contingent of Shaw technicians. To avoid a legal dispute about his contract with Shaws, Li left Hong Kong for Taipei with financial backing from the Cathay Organization (which MP & GI had become in 1965) and two film companies in Taiwan. Guolian succeeded in stimula the increase in production of Mandarin films in Taiwan, from 10 in 1964 to 46 in 1967.In 1968 output leapt to 116, and by 1970 had reached 163, more than twice that of Hong Kong: This can only be explained by the popularity of the martial arts genre and the opportunistic nature of an industry unregulated by big studios. taking ting

industry proved short-lived, and by the mid-1970s Hong Kong had replaced it as the producer of popular martial arts movies. Guolian had folded at the end of the 1960s, and Li Hanxiang was heavily in debt. This finally drove him back to Hong to re-enter Shaw Brothers in 1972.The surprise return of the prodigal prqved to be valuable in helping Shaws face the most formidable defector; Raymond Chow. Chow had been the production manager at Shaws before he left with group of Shaws Kong

company; Golden Harvest, in April 1970.Thenew company soon had the backing of Cathay; which acted as its distribution arm in Singapore and Malaysia. This move eventually broke Shaws' monopoly of the market.

Following the death of Bruce Lee in 1973,and as a result of excessive exploitation by opportunistic producers; the success of kung-fu films looked to be in decline. But the genre saw signs of rejuvenation with Cheh's early work in Taiwan, Heroes Two (Fangshiyu yu xiguan, 1973) these films Chang introduced the legends of the Shaolin school of boxing, and filmed the combat   styles and sequences in great detail. These elements were exploited to new choreographer; later turned to directing. Liu was probably the most accomplished film-maker in the kung-fu decade and the only auteur working under the studio system. He directed seventeen features before leaving Shaws in 1985 including classics like Challenge of the Masters (Luacai yu huangfeihong, 1976) and Ho (Lantou he, 1979). Another master of the martial arts genre, Hu, found it easier to work in Taiwan, where he made his most accomplished works including A Touch of Zen (Xianu, 1972). Chang hong Dirty King

After a slow start, Golden Harvest's breakthrough came with Bruce Lee's The Big Boss (Tangshan daxiong, Luo Wei, history  It also shifted the emphasis to actors with authentic martial techniques. As a logical development of the new-style martial arts film, kung-fu films dominated the local screens for most of the 1970s, as well as making an genre signified a fundamental and lasting change in Kong cinema: action was valued over drama, and male stars replaced female stars as the main box office appeal. Moreover;, locally produced films proved continually more popular than Hollywood products and continued to have the largest share (between 50 per cent and 70 per cent) of the market into the 1990s.

## The revival of 'Cantonese' cinema

The dominance of the martial arts and kung-fu films from late 1960s to early 1970s can perhaps be explained by the fact that Hong Kong was entering the boom phase of allout capitalist expansion and materialist development. It was natural for the population to indulge in the quest for excitement and pleasures of the senses. The stock market crash of 1973 marked a recession in the local economy, and a change in film tastes The House of 72 Tenants (Qishier in Cantonese, broke all the boxoffice records held by Bruce Lee's films, and helped revive the indigenous cinema.

Débuting in Shaws The Warlord (Da Junfa, Li Hanxiang, 1972), Michael Hui moved to Golden Harvest, and became

directorial début Games Gamblers Play (Guima shuangxing and set another new box-office record . Dubbing films into Cantonese became the new trend, and by the end of the 1970s, Mandarin was used in only 20 per cent of the films shown. Television was an important factor in this respect; during the few years when only Mandarin was heard at the cinemas, television maintained its broadcasting in Cantonese, thus keeping the   potential market alive Michael Hui started his career on TV on the Hui Brothers Show (1970), and the gag-show format of the programme was to have a profound influence on the episodic structure and 'instant gratification' aspect of Hong Kong cinema in the 1970s

Comicsatires in Cantonese became another major trend beside the kung-fu action signal a revival of the od Cantonese cinema. All films were produced by the existing (previously Mandarin) system, and dialogues (whether Cantonese or Mandarin) were dubbed in later. There no longer existed different distribution networks Or theatrical circuits for the two kinds of cinema, nor was there any difference in ticket as in the previous decade In other words, the dichotomy of Mandarin and Cantonese cinema after the Second World War almost disappeared, and there emerged new breed of Kong cinema which later blossomed in the 1980sGone were the didacticism and beliefs in cinema as a potential educational art form; cynicism was the prevalent attitude to entertain. Exploitation films with excessive sex and violence flooded the screens to a degree that horrified the critics. Chang Cheh might be rightly blamed for making blood and gore fashionable, but it was Li Hanxiang who introduced the sexploitation genre to Hong Kong cinema through his highly successful series offengyue films, which mixture of soft porn, satire, and comedy. grounding vulgarity as the basic human trait, the films of the series were seminal works that heralded the direction film culture of the 1970s Hong goal

Towards the end of the decade, a popular new subgenre emerged that amalgamated kung-fu films with the social satires of the early 1970s: the kung-fu comedy. Following Liu Jialiang's lead, number of martial arts instructors like Sammo Hung and Yuen Wooping, turned into successful directors of this genre Jackie   Chan achieved stardom in Yeun's phenomenally successful Drunken Master (Zui quan, 1978). The kung-fu comedy combined spectacular and humorous action sequences with clever use of slang, puns, and television advertising slogans as in-jokes. Its heroes were ordinary characters driven only

In this respect, Tsui Hark is the most representative of the 'New Wave' directors. After three commercial failures , hejoined theCinema All the Wrong Clues (for the Right Solution) (Guima zhiduoxing 1981).

## THE MODERN PERIOD

The 'New Wave' phenomenon which burst on the scene in 1979 marked new era, in which Hong Kong cinema established its identity and announced the coming of age of the indigenous culture, where artists and technicians travel freely across the spectrum from film to television and pop music. The New Wave' directors belonged to new generation of film-makers born and educated in Hong Kong, who had undergone vocational training in film schools in the west, and displayed their talents in television before did not establish a clean break with tradition, early works such Hark's Butterfly Murders (Die bian, 1979), and Allen Fong's Father and Son (Fu zi qing, 1980) did display a more sophisticated visual style and a more westernized (yet typical of modern Hong Kong) consciousness than their pre decessors . they they

The works of the 'New Wave' film-makers were generally marked by realism and technical competence. Most had modern settings  and operated within  highly popular genres like crime thrillers-for example Alex Cheung's and Robbers (Dian zhi 'New Wave' can be seen as successful replay of the 1960s failed experiment to modernize Cantonese cinema by   adapting western genres.

Cinema City's rapid rise to the top of the industry was spectacular.

The situation did not improve even after the estab and fifth distribution outlets (Newport, founded in 1988, and Mandarin, 1993), as the number of theatres in Hong Kong drastically increased worse as film production rose and more mediocre or below-average productions flooded the market, dealing a serious blow to the productions that strayed from the mainstream to make a profit in the 1990s

This rise in the number of productions would not have been possible without the influx of foreign investment

Thus, ironically, the gradual drop of annual attendance by 25 per cent from the recent peak of 66 million in 1988 was indirectly caused by the huge success that Hong Kong films achieved overseas in the 1980s. pour

New genres?

In terms of genre development; the modern period of Hong Kong cinema is a continuation of the major trends (kung-fu and comedy) of the 1970s. More polished visuals remained the staples of Hong Kong movies

The valuable experience gained in making kung-fu films for nearly two decades , coupled with the introduction of special effects hardware from the west, produced brilliant action stunts and flamboyant visual effects in the Hong Kong films of this period. These are best embodied in the opened up new markets like Japan and South Korea, and received releases in Europe and America

The is strongly characterized by genre combinations, where all subject-matters are game for comedy. This reflects the industry's audiences in the community; essential after the drastic rise in production budgets following Cinema City's lead. Comedies remain an overwhelmingly popular genre; the quick rhythm, and preponderance of gags.

The evolution and adaptation of kung-fu into other genres has been complicated. The early works of the New Wave directors in thriller genre were more heavily influenced by Hollywood, and succeeded in imparting a fresh feel to audiences by shooting in real

## Taiwanese New Cinema

## JUNE YIP

The Taiwanese cinema is best known in the west for its kung-fu and other action films which for a time rivalled Hong Kong films in world-wide popularity. But Taiwan is also home to movement known as 'Taiwanese New Cinema' , of which the best-known representative is Hou Hsiaohsien.

Taiwan entered period of self-reflection that resulted, in part; in the awakening of nationalistic sentiments, a renewed interest in indigenous cultural traditions, and blossoming of   sociopolitical awareness most clearly evidenced by the emergence of   hsiang-t'u, OI nativist, literature By insisting on 'making Taiwan the centre' t'u literature broke from the nostalgia literature of the mainland refugee writers from the western-influenced literature of the educated élite; and from the escap popular fiction of the era.

Taiwanese New Cinema is, in many ways, the cinematic heir to this nativist tradition One ofthe two portmanteau films that heralded the 'birth' of New Cinema, His Son's three shortstories by Huang Ch'un-ming, predecessor, New Cinema marked a significant departure from established traditions. Taiwanese cinema of the 1970s was in a moribund state Due in part to strict government censorship that discouraged socio-political analysis , the Hollywood-styled commercial studios did little more than churn out fantasy martial arts films, formulaic melodramas , and teen romances . These were rapidly ground to imported films and videotapes from America, Japan, and Hong Kong, which not only crushed domestic films undermined public confidence in the native film industry. By the early 1980s, the desire to revitalize the industry and win back commercial success and critical respectability for Taiwanese cinema prompted the government to allow from epics , losing finally

The chief beneficiaries of this cultural liberalization were the young Taiwanese men and women who, born in thelate 1940s and early 195Os and educated in film schools in the USA, were, in the early 1980s, just beginning their careers in film-making. They seized the opportunity to make films that were not only technically more innovative, but also addressed the pressing social and cultural difficulties modern Taiwan. Born in 1947 in Kuangprovince on the Chinese mainland, Hou Hsiaohsien fled to Taiwan with his family at the time of the Communist take-over in 1949.Like his Cinema colleagues , therefore first-hand its emergence from ffty-one years of repressive Japanese occupation, its adjustment to Kuomintang (KMT) rule, and its transformation from traditional agrarian society into a modern urban industrial power. Unlike the others, however; Hou did not study abroad. Instead, beginning in 1973, he followed a more conventional route of as script-writer, production assistant, and as an assistant facing tung New

director under several established directors. His first three flms were and are not con sidered to be of any great significance

With his fourth and breakthrough film, His Son's Big Doll , Hou finally freed himself from the constraints of potboiler film-making began to find his own voice In the films that followed, The Boys from Fengkuei (1983), Summer at Grandpa's (1984), and A Time to Live and a Time to Die (1985), Hou began to articulate a distinct cinematic style that was a far cry from the action-driven, fast cutting style of the commercial cinema. Hou is a laconic and story-teller, downplaying the dramatic by offering leisurely observations of small, He favours meditative takes with a minimum of camera movements, most often in medium or long shot favourite technique is to allow the camera simply to stare at an empty room that a character is about to enter or has just left, frequently making masterful use, through the soundtrack, of off-screen space. Like the Japanese director Yasu jiro Ozu\_to whom Hou is most often compared but whose influence he denies-Hou punctuates his films with shots of rural landscapes, abandoned corridors, lonely railway platforms, deserted pool halls, and empty dining-rooms His cinematic stylehas been compared to classical Chinese poetry; to traditional landscape painting, and to Buddhist narrative scrolls and oblique

Hou also found a central theme around which all his films revolve: what does it mean to be modern Taiwanese? The autobiographical A Time to Live and a Time to Die, widely considered to be his first masterpiece, transcends its personal comingofage story to become an examination Taiwanese life, graceful and elegiac tracing of Taiwan's history from the KMT government's exile to Taiwan in 1949, through its decades of quasi-colonial rule on the island, to the gradual relinquishing of the dream of returning to the mainland. The Boys from Fengkuei and Summer at Grandpa's, like the later Dust in the Wind (1987), address the social tensions created by Taiwan's rapid urbanization, particularly the growing gap between the values and life-style ofthe industrialized metropolis and the rural Daughters of the Nile (1987) is the only one of Hou's films set exclusively in the city; but, like the others, it depicts the problems faced by Taiwanese youth caught up in asociety that is changing with bewildering speed. It raises important questions about the collapse of traditional values in the face of American and Japanese cultural imperialism. villages.

quest for an attempt to recover of Taiwanese history that, for Hou, is fundamental to an understanding of contemporary Taiwanese society, the frequently antagonistic relationship between the governand and the continuing tensions between mainlanders and the native Taiwanese. The film generated controversy and debate in Taiwan because it dared to depict the corruption, greed, and brutality that accompanied the KMT take-over of the island, focusing on the infamous February incident of 1947-until recently denied by official history\_in which native islanders protesting at the unfair policies of the KMT were savagely repressed .

It presenting multiple; conflicting views of the same event; made many interpretations possible and demanded active reading by the audience. Rashomon was the first film to introduce the concept of the modern into Japanese cinema

Modernization first appeared in a change in the subjectmatter tackled by film-makers For example Nikkatsu's Taiyo no kisetsu ('Season of the sun' , Takumi Furukawa, 1956), adapted from the novel of Shintaro Ishihara, approached the subject of the anger of modern youth by directly depicting the rebellion of juveniles against the older generation. The film was not innovative in terms of film form, but by using the classical narrative mode drew attention to the challenge to tradition represented by new Ishihara's new novel Kurutta kajitsu ( 'Crazed fruit' , Ko Nakahira, 1956) This represented an attempt to establish the angry youth' film as genre, after the model of Nicholas Ray's Rebel without a Cause and Ingmar Bergman's Summer with Monika. There was bourgeois idealism inherent in the literature of Ishihara which was mirrored in these adaptations of his work. The films lacked any dimension of classconsciousness but represented rebellious youth in an imaginary world This tendency towards a lack of realism of setting was to constitute an important element to come.

While Nikkatsu's youth films were set in imaginary bourgeois circumstances , Shohei Imamura, working in the same company; developed a very different milieu for his films . After working as theassistant director to Yasujiro Ozu at Shochiku, Imamura moved to Nikkatsu to work with Kawashima\_ Since his début film in 1958 by the development of Japanese bourgeois society; and the energetic people in that world. His films were fundamentally different from the Nikkatsu action films, as were not dependent on the method of realism. They included caricature-like depictions ofstrange people, blended concerns, and humour inherited from Kawashima. Many ofhis films from this period bore more resemblance to films made by independent companies than the output ofa major studio like Nikkatsu. After Nippon konchuki ('Insect woman Nikkatsu, 1963) Imamura's concerns gravitated towards issues of sex, and his films examined the sexual impulse that he believed existed at the root of all people. Yuzo living they

In the then, Nikkatsu tried to modernize Japanese cinema by establishing a new genre, aimed at and the popular success of many ofthese films the genre rarely produced anything other than standardized B movies of little lasting interest. This had much to do with the restrictions placed on film-makèrs by the studios. The genre did not attract eminent established directors, nOI produce The one exception was Seijun Suzuki, who began his directing career making action films for

Nikkatsu. He made series of these films between 1956 and 1963 which were classed as B movies, but which stood out from those made by other genre specialists of the time. He ornamented the stereotyped story-lines of the genre with deliberately artificial images; and he pushed the most standard action film beyond the ordinary through the use ofattractive shotcomposition and unique mise-en-scène After 1964, promoted from low-budget B films, he turned his hand to adapting literature for the screen, but he continued to develop the style he had established on his action movies. Gradually Suzuki decreased the importance of a rational and logical story in his films. brand of conventions dictate should be clear, was transformed into labyrinth. The increasing complexity and difficulty of his films finally led to his dismissal from Nikkatsu in 1968.

Kiriro Urayama directed realistic films with a social message at Nikkatsu. He had been the assistant director to Imamura before making his first film in 1962, and he went on to work mostly in the youth film genre. However; films like Kyupora no aru machi 'The street with the cupola', Nikkatsu, 1962) and Hiko shojo (The bad girl' , Nikkatsu; 1963) were different from the stereotyped Nikkatsu films contained political elements. By the late 1960s, both Imamura and Urayama had developed a metaphysical quality in their films. Urayama's last film at Nikkatsu; Watashi ga suteta onna (The girl I abandoned' , 1969) concentrated on the subjective experiences of a man they

who had abandoned a girl. However; this highly reflective film, which included shots, was thought too abstract by the Nikkatsu executives. The film companies did not like to see their directors bring such experimental elements to their work. Directors were required to follow the norms of the genre and remain within the limits and rules laid down by their companies . Directors with a desire to experiment had to fight continually with the conservatism of the executives of their companies . and many found it an impossible task. Imamura realized that he could not make the films he wanted to at major studio. After making Akai satsui 'Intentions of murder in 1963 he left Nikkatsu to found his own independent production company.

During the 1950s most independent companies had been organized by groups with socialist sympathies. Directors like Tadashi Imai and Satsuo Yamamoto produced films with political message The independent sector; and could not be considered avant-garde. However; in the be made at the major studios but that were primarily concerned with extending theboundaries ofJapanese film and not just with political messages from a specific party. Out of such newly founded independent companies, the

From the late 1950s the bulk of Nikkatsu output had been genre staples such as the youth film and action film. The classics of Japanese cinema of the 1950s had been produced by Daiei: Ugetsu monogatari (1953), Chikamatsu monogatari ('The crucified lovers 1954), Naruse's Inazuma ('Lightning' 1952), Kinugasa's Jigokumon ('Gate of hell' , 1953), and Kozaburo Yoshimura's Yoru no kawa ('Night river' 1956).

In 1951 Akira Kurosawa's film Rushomon (1950) won the the doors of the western art circuit to Japanese cinema Rashomon consists of four different versions of the same event, the attackon a nobleman by a bandit, and despite its Japanese setting is conceptualized around a very occidental theme; the relativity oftruth. This combinationof Japanese western infuences is feature of Kuro filmmaking; and has contributed to his continuing popularity in the West and

However, Kurosawa sought more than the intellectual world view of European literature. He also developed film asan entertainment form He was deeply influenced by Hollywood movies, particularly those of John Ford. That which Ford expressed through the Western ap peared in the form of jidaigeki (period films) in Kuro Kakushitoride no sanakunin (The Hidden Fortress, 1958).

Eventually prominent new talents only energed the two oldest of the companies: Nikkatsu and Shochiku. pendent companies were to constitute the Japanese New Wave in the 1960s they from large they

At Nikkatsu young film-makers who had developed their talents within the company (like Seijun Suzuki, Shohei Imamura, and Kirio Urayama) were leaving to further their artistic visions. A similar thing was pening at Shochiku. Shochiku was very conservative company and regulated and protected even the tone of their films . Yasujiru Ozu continued to make a film each Kinoshita had been given any kind of autonomy.

Oshima's Seishun zankoku monogatari ('A story of cruelty of youth' , Shochiku, 1960) depicted young people's destruction with a harsh reality that had been absent from previous youth films. Produced in the middle of the campaign the Japan-USA Security Treaty, political messages were woven into the drama. However; unlike the leftist party-political films of the independent companies, Oshima's message was directed toward the audience's own identity and independence; and it is this which gives the film its avant-garde In Nihon no yoru to kiri (Night and in Japan, Shochiku, 1960) which deliberately echoed the title of Resnais's 1955 film on concentration camps, Nuit et brouillard , political discussion was central to the film, reaching beyond the scope sanctioned by Shochiku's production policy: Oshima was forced to leave the studio and from this worked outside the mainstream by founding his own production company. selfagainst edge Fog point

The conservatism of Shochiku prevented them from exploiting the rise of new genres like the action film which Nikkatsu and other companies were successfully producing. This policy precipitated the decline of Sho chiku's fortunes at the box-office As company began to lose its place as one of Japan's major studios. Under pressure, Shochiku launched a new policy their traditional films, the company gave young directors the opportunity to make the films wanted with new degree of freedom the attention of the young audience who had not so called Shochiku New Wave directors Nagisa Oshima, Yoshishige Yoshida, and Masahiro Shinoda emerged on to the stage of Japanese film they turing

Yoshishige   Yoshida's Rokudenashi   ('Good-for-nothing 1960) was in many ways similar to Oshima's Seishun zankoku monogatari.  Rokudenashi takes as its subject the crimes of four students, and in it Yoshida tried to achieve new type of drama by deconstructing the traditional ideology of Shochiku. His next film Chi wa kawaiteru Dry blood' , 1960) was also ofsocial concern evident in an attempt todeconstructand Masahiro Shinoda's Kawaita mizuumi 1960) also had students as the protagonists. These three new Shochiku directors revealed the violent of the modern society in which they lived, through films focusing on the lives and behaviour of people oftheir own generation. This Wave at Shochiku lasted a very short because its central figure, Oshima, left the company shortly after making Night and Fog in Japan. In spite of this, Yoshida and Shinoda remained at Shochiku until the mid-1960s and both made interesting films within the limits of the company' s policy filns, college reality New period

Hiroshi Teshigahara was another influential film-maker who emerged the independent sector. As in the case of Susumu Hani, Teshigahara's success lay in the unique film form he was able to develop from his position outside the major film companies. Like Hani he had made documentaries in the 1950s, which were the ofdeparture for his feature films. From his first feature, Otoshi ana The pitfall' , 1962), he devoted himself to adaptations of Kobo Abe's literature. The visualization of existentialist stories was his main concern throughout the 1960s , Susa no onna ('Woman in the dunes' , 1964) the most successful work among these adaptations. from point being

Some New Wave directors appeared from outside the major companies. Susumu Hani had been working in the 1950s at Iwanami Eiga, the film-production section of a publishing company which made science and education films, and so his method of direction was completely different from that of those who studied film-making in the mainstream film companies. In 1961 he made his first feature Furyo shonen ('Bad boys'), using the mixed styles of was based around the lives of boys in reformatory, Hani did not use professional actors but improvised scenes with who had experience of such institutions In sequent films Hani continued to documentary method of shooting which came to be seen as an alternative form of fiction film It influenced other makers, for example Shohei Imamura, who used a similar method in Ningen johatsu ('A man vanishes 1967). boys

continued to increase to 1958, but thereafter gradually declined. The film companies tried to recapture audiences by producing films in colour and films featuring estab lished stars. In 1957 the Toei production company shifted production practices to the manufacture of widescreen (The life of the Buddha' , directed by Kenji Misumi), which appealed to the audience's desire to see dramaticspectacle on large screen.

The monster film, the ghost film, and the Tora-san series were made specifically to be the spectacles of particular seasons. However, from the early 1960s when television audiences began to surpass those of the cinema, the fve ities. The yakuza (gangster) film genre from Toei sold on the sensationalism of violence; is one of the most prominent examples. From the late 1960s and into the 1970s yakuza films were made continually. At Toho, monster films as well as wordy war films were made as seasonal spectacles, and for their regular programme Toho emphasized films and comedies. Shochiku also stressed the comedy which films like the Tora-san series were born. Nikkatsu and Daiei, however, could not penetrate such genre lines and their fortunes declined as a result. youth from

Although the technology was new; there was strong tradition of spectacles of this kind in Japanese cinema, and so there was ready-made audience for these ductions\_ For example, every summer the major comreleased ghost film, and in December, new of the dramatic story of the loyal   forty-seven Ronin. Following the box offce success ('Godzilla' , Ishiro Honda) in 1954 Toho released many monster and science-fiction films every year. The pro duction policies of big film producers   exploited the custom for Japanese people to enjoy something individual and special in each season. From 1969 Shochiku produced the series Otoko wa tsuraiyo (Tora-san', Yoji Yamada) for seasonal viewing. The policy of recycling a spectacle in aseries of films had been a part ofJapanese cinema since the silent years. These repeating spectacles had conco-existed with, but never crossed with, the creation of art cinema. The yearly repetition of a dramatic spectacle film in a was almost identical, but their popularity ensured that they were used as last resort by the big companies to defend cinema audiences from erosion by television. propanies huge specific cycle

## SEX AND VIOLENCE

In 1971 Daiei went bankrupt and Nikkatsu took the dramatic step of turning to the production of soft-core pornography; called roman poruno. Sex films had been made

in Japan by independent companies since around 1963 under the name of pink film. At that time there had been some sex films which had drawn critics, and the ìine between pornography and mainstream cinema was not rigid. For example, some of the sex films of Koji Wakamatsu had certain avantgarde elements and political edge, and his work had been evaluated highly from early on. The works of Tetsuji Takechi were the most famous sex films before Nikkatsu launched the were released through mainstream companies and screened in ordinary theatres. Takechi's sex films Hakujitsu mu ('Daydream 1964) and Kokeimu ('Scarlet daydream* 1964) are regarded as having artistic value, particularly in the use of hallucinatory sequences Praise

After November 1971 most films produced by Nikkatsu were sex films, resulting in the unique phenomenon of major studio turning exclusively to the production of pornography. However; while the roman poruno was part of the sex film genre it was essentially narrative cinema with many sex scenes and different from the explicit pornography of the so-called blue films. In early roman porunos, directors like Tatsumi Kumashiro, Toru Murakawa, and Toshiya Fujita developed interesting films, and the genre soon became Some of the directors who would later constitute the core of Japanese cinema learnt their craft from the roman poruno

In the 1970s, with Daiei bankrupt, Nikkatsu making the roman poruno, and the three other major companies only manufacturing stereotyped genre films, there was little scope for the production of highquality art cinema in Japan. Collaboration with the Arts Theatre Guild (ATG) provided the only opening for directors interested in this area. ATG had been founded with the aim of importing quality foreign films, both classic and modern, into Japan. In 1968 ATG began to produce films in collaboration with other independent companies. This provided a home for the directors of the New Wave who had been forced to leave the major companies, and ATG helped realize the further development of the work of Shohei Imamura Nagisa Oshima, Masahiro Shinoda and Yoshishige Yoshida. The company did not only help the New Wave directors of the 1960s, but also provided opportunities for younger film-makers like the television director Akio Jissoji; and the poet Shuji Terayama. However; the golden age of ATG did not last more than ten years, and by the late 1970s it was no longer the centre of creative Japanese cinema

The degeneration of quality Japanese cinema became conspicuous in the late 1970s. In 1975 the yearly boxoffice profts of imported foreign films surpassed those of Japanese films.In this the entrance fees at cinemas in Japan were the highest in the world and the numbers period

Toei was still producing yakuza films and Nikkatsu was still duction policies which assumed (and ensured) that the primary audience was male. About half of the cinemas that showed Japanese films were never entered by women Toei produced programmes for children as their seasonal spectacle in summer and winter, and so during the holithe film theatres filled with children and their Parents. This gave rise to the strange phenomenon of family seasons, sandwiched between times when films of sex and violence were shown to exclusively male audiences days busy

In the late 1970s a new development added an edge to Japanese cinema. Young peoplein their teens and twenties began to make films with 8mm. or 16 mm. cameras and exhibit them to general audiences. Among these amateur film-makers were some who would go on to give fresh power to the impoverished national cinema. The directors

Since the mid-1980s, many of the major companies' films had depended on manga (Japanese comics) as their story sources. By adapting the story of manga printed in weekly magazines, certain measure of box office profit is assured because of the already tremendous popularity of the story-line and characters \_ The power of manga is becoming nearly as influential as literature in Japanese cinema However, there has to be truly cinematic work based on a manga story yet

Animated films have been made in Japan since the silent years. As early as the mid-1910s some excellent animated films were imental series Chiyogami Anime. After the war Toei emphasized the production of feature-length animated films Japan, the majority for children. However; the situation changed in the 1980s, with feature-length animation for broader audience being produced. One of the most important directors of this animation is Hayao Miyazaki, whose works, such as Tonari no Totoro ('Totoro, the neighbourhood 1988), constitute a definitive example of contemporary Japanese art\_ ghost ' ,

Until the 1970s cinema was in close collaboration with television. All the major companies were making television flms in parallel with their theatrical releases. In

the 1980s the situation became more complicated on account of the diffusion ofvidee; The film companies were the suppliers of films for television and the video market; ences are drawn away from the cinemas\_ Within months of its theatrical release film can be seen on the small screen, either on broadcast television Or on tation of film classics, but the cheap rental fee of videos caused a decrease in the number of cinema patrons. The circulation of pornographic videos also struck a blow to the production of roman poruno. From the late 1980s Nikkatsu's box office were diminishing each year; and in 1993 Nikkatsu; the oldest film company in Japan, went bankrupt

In recent years several different have competed for popularity In the late 19805, for example; films with animals in the leading roles enjoyed great success. Audiences also gathered to see the ania broad spectrum of the public, as well as films for children, are considered secure profitable subjects for the studios It is true that some part of Japanese cinema has become infantile, but in order to attract audiences the film companies have forced to produce such films made films using popular TV personalities to attract teenagers, the reverse of thirty years before, when people went to film theatres to see the actors who could not be seen on the television genres been They

The condition of Japanese cinema in the 1990s is still that theatrical Japanese cinema may disappear altogether. The Tora-san series and animated films for families are still guaranteed source of profit; but the situation has become so difficult that film can no longer be produced with the creative freedom enjoyed by directors of the New Wave

## New Australian Cinema

## STEPHEN CROFTS

Since the 1970s Australian films have increasingly come to world attention Critically acclaimed films such as Picnic at Hanging Rock (Peter Weir; 1975) and My Brilliant (Gillian Armstrong, 1979) have been followed by the major international successes of Mad Max (George Miller; 1979), (Baz Luhrmann, 1992). Then, in 1993, New Zealand-born Jane Campion became the first woman to win the Palme Piano (1993), sharing the prize with Chen Kaige's Farewell my Concubine (1993).Itis an impressive record for a country with a population of only 18 million; especially one whose feature film industry had been moribund throughout the 1960s Career

## THE 1960s

During the 1960s only fifteen features were made in Aus-tralia\_ Of   these, eight were wholly Or substantially financed and controlled by non-Australian interests While there had been continuous documentary filmmaking throughout the post-1945 drought of features , cinema screens had been dominated by Hollywood, and sporadically by British product. The 1960s most significant films were the popular Italian immigrant-Australian girl love story of the UK co-production They're a Weird Mob (Michael Powell, 1966), and the self-consciously all-Australian 2000 Weeks (Tim Burstall, 1969), heralding the feature renaissance long

The revival of Australian film in the 1970s was preceded by a quarter-century of such minimal production There was another; more broadly historical against which the resurrected feature production had to struggle.

Distributors were hostile to Australian product. Prior to ture producers routinely took their films direct to individual down-market city theatres; as the distributors; all dominated by American interests, preferred the proven track records and ready-made publicity packages of Hollywood imports. However; in 1973 the Tariff Board Report recommended 'legislative provision to adjust and regulate the ownership and control of cinemas' , and although the recommendation was never implemented distributors and exhibitors felt threatened. Hence the 1973 Australia-wide release of Alvin Purple, and increasing subsequent investtributors. The lower-budget experimental sector; funded by the EFTF, fell way below the threshold of visibility in The anomaly of government subsidy for producing films that went virtually unseen was often fea

The principal funding agency of 1970-5 was the AFDC, which proclaimed commercial and investor-oriented policy In default of any feature film infrastructure, any regular production practices or generic traditions; or any pool of personnel Or marketing expertise; its funding decisions were understandably hit-and-miss. The EFTF sup ported mostly short, experimental work suchas cartoonist Bruce  Petty's eighteen-minute tour de force, Australian History (1971), and Peter Weir's black comedy short Homesdale (1972). During this period the industry was enthusiastically amateurish, working with budgets below ASO.Sm., with crew members often on multiple from television; documentary; or commercials taking

Quite apart from the problems cf distributors reluctance to screen Australian product, the film-makers themselves had little clear conception of their audiences. The 1960s' avant-garde and documentary  production and smattering of features afforded the revived feature indusfew guidelines. The features made in 1970-2 ranged wildly student Godard hommage and experimental narratives to TV spin off, social realism, and coproductions including Ned Kelly (Tony Richardson, 1970, starring Mick Jagger) , Walkabout (Nicolas 1971), and 1971) With such variable notions of style and address, it is little surthat generic patterns did not emerge fully-fledged. thirty try from prise

The 'ocker' comedy were boosted by the 1971 relaxation ofthe previously draconian censorship laws New classifications opened up an adult market which Hollywood had not yet cornered, and, time, cult audiences had some clout. The ocker comedy appealed both and to the more middle-class permissive, libertarian counter-culture. Although decried by critics for their lack of clear moral stance Or high-art seriousness , the ocker comedies tapped into culturally strains of humour; sexism, and strident self-assertion sometimes undercut by deprecation. Their protagonists offered a range of forms of viewer attachment from empathic identifications to disavowal.

It was not until 1972 that the first genre began to emerge. The Adventures of Barry McKenzie (Bruce Beresford , 1972) confirmed the success of the of 'ocker comedies inaugurated by Stork (Tim Burstall, 1971), and became the film which decisively called attention to the rebirth of the feature film industry.

Tapping into less populist strains were several films exploring the underside ofthe ocker' s brash openness and unthinking sexism. The most important of these were the co-production Wake in Fright (1971), which offered trenchant critique of Australian masculinity through story of young schoolteacher trapped in an outback experimental Shirley Thompson versus (Peter Weir; 1974). Shirley subverts the 'normality' of suburbia, while Weir's first feature locates its horror in the cannibalistic car culture of an outback town.

In the early 1970s there also emerged a group of films more closely resembling European art cinema. The strongest, Between Wars (Michael Thornhill, 1974) boldly essayed range of   issues from inter-war Australia-Fascism, psychoanalysis, cultural conservatism, and Australia's distance from the rest of the world-as seen through the disengaged consciousness of its protagonist.

## 1975-1980: THE AFC PERIOD

If Sunday Too was the watershed film which pointed the industry towards an art-film culture; it was

Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) which clinched the official moves against the ocker comedies and sex features characterizing the AFDC period. For while soft-core films had continued box office success, the period genre had the firm imprimatur of the new statutory body.

This was phase of consolidation of the production industry overseen and the AFC Although some distributors; notably the Greater Union Organization, did increase their investment in pro duction, the distribution-exhibition sector of the industry continued to operate industrially, while the production sector continued to be artisanal. Yet regular patterns of funding, production, and distribution began to cohere By the end of the 1970s, most features could rely on distribution by the majors, and many of the major creative personnel of the next decade emerged: amongst Phil Noyce, George Miller; while the adaptable Bruce Beresford moved with ease from ocker comedies to period films.A marked overseas critical profile was achieved, and with it critical prestige at home. Budget sizes remained remarkably low by international standards-not least to enthusiastic cheap labour-averaging just over Production rates, despite one features in 1979. owing

Despite this success the AFC was caught in dilemma which the AFDC had paradoxically avoided by supporting films. It had to discharge the dual responsibilities of nurturing an industry which was supposedly to be handed over eventually to the private sector; and simas a form of cultural rep resentation, as a way of showing the nation The ocker option now discredited the local variant on the quality art film, namely the period instanced by Picnic, appeared to be the answer, especially given both the the fact that it recouped its costs within a popular year.

The film, then, became the flagship of the second half of the 1970s. It constituted a reaction against bodily functions; and frequently advanced strong, independent women and sidelined recessive, sensitive men. Often enjoying the cultural cachet of a literary source, these films blended the aesthetic protocols of European art film with those of British quality television drama, to project a polite gentility, a certain innocence, a a moral and itical blandness. Character took precedence over action, andsensibility overissues ofethical choice The narratives were largely episodic and ineonclusive; often tracing tales of adolescent maturation. Camera movement and mise-enscène languorously exposed Australian light, land, flora and fauna, and period costume and décor. Aestheticizing period genre

the uncanny desolation of the Australian landscape, often in the manner of the Heidelberg school of painting; the cinematography presented within Australia sense

As regards history, however; the period film talgically unspecific. It relegated history to the aesthetic, to a meticulous miseen-scène of costumes and antiques. Yet its historical settings were intriguingly fixated on the rebellious moment of Australia's nominal independence from Britain In a phase of some political and moral uncertainty following the 1975 dismissal of the Whitlam government, the period film perhaps offered both escape from the present, and an assertion that white Australia had history; a national past-

The finestjustification for the etiolated life ofthe period film in this phase was My Brilliant Career; which did not appear until 1979. It stood as the most resonant of the films, because of Gillian Armstrong's stylish direction and engagement with the subject, because of Judy Davis's performance in first starring role, because it tapped into contemporary strains of career feminism. It women in all major roles: Armstrong as director, Margaret Fink as Other notable period films included The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (Fred Schepisi, 1978) whose violent black Australian anger broke open the confines of this respectably tame genre, but also did something of disservice to Aboriginal representations in allowing readings of the 'mad black' variety. period her and

The period film faded quickly at the boxoffice with many of its most prestigious productions failing to break even at home. But while the period film had lost its Australian audience, overseas markets, where its calculated innocence had marked appeala new national voice on the world scenesent back (much delayed) messages to The period film was seam to mine either aesthetically or in terms of clarifying any national identity; but it was one which the AFC was locked its conservative sense of commercial responsibility.

By contrast to the period film, the historical film, which made serious engagement with history; has been rare. Probably its finest instance is Newsfront (Phil Noyce, 1978) Scripted by Bob Ellis, it boldly links public and private by cross-cutting a social and political history of 1948-56, via newsreels , with the life of a newsreel cameraman. Len Maguire, avatar of left Labor Australian values, serves as an ethical touchstone in period covering the sclerotic dominance of the Menzies Conservative government, its referendum tooutlaw the Communist Party; and the country's seduction by American consumerist values and telefilm cast its protagonists as period

This was film which stretched the limited adventurousness of AFC funding.

Mad Max (1979) was arguably the most important film of this phase Miller and producer Byron Kennedy were convinced-doubtless correctly-that the AFC would not In raising the money privately; and making such a successful film, they inspired those who wished to privatize the industry and had much influence on the subsequent development of Australian cinema The film launched the career of that 1980s icon necting with strains of Australian masculinity which were

## 1980-1988: THE 1OBA PERIOD

At the end of the 1970s, the failure of Australian films at the unexpected local and overseas success of the privately financed Mad Max combined to generate an atmosphere of change. Accountants Peat, Marwick and Mitchell were commissioned to report on the state of the production industry: One sentence summarizes that report: 'The AFC is in the money business, not the movie business ' Their proposals were accepted, and the AFC became servicing organization; rather than an active agent in production. Stockbrokers now displaced cultural bureaucrats as cipal arbiters of funding decisions; and an energetically commercialist ethos was introduced

It was the tax incentives scheme called 'IOBA' after the relevant section of the Income Tax Assessment Act which gave its name to the period 1980 until the 1988 establishment of the Film Finance Corporation An instrument of privatization, the scheme replaced direct with indirect state funding, offering such generous tax concessions for investors that only 10 per cent return was needed in order to break even, and money could follow from

script with blithe unconcern for its quality. While the degrees of generosity of the tax breaks were progressively scaled down through the 1980s, the corollary financial and legal infrastructure became a fixed feature, especially for higher-budgeted productions:   lawyers, executive producers with of up to S0.5m., brokerage fees, multiple insurances. Togetherwith higher wages and budget escalation: from an average of $599,000 per feature fees

Given the small size of the domestic market, the escalating budgets and declining tax breaks of the 1980s obliged producers to seek overseas distribution guarantees and pre-sales. The key overseas market was the USA, which was not only thirteen times larger; but also anglo phone. This resulted in medium-range US film or video distributors bargaining, and usually winning, on matters of casting; director; and plot changes, e.g. the casting of Meryl Streep in Evil Angels (also known as A Cry in the Dark Fred Schepisi, 1988). The IOBA phase thus sharply focused national cinemas operating in the shadow of Hollywood. 'significant' Australian content and made 'wholly or being

an atrophying industry. The inflow of private money more than increased production rates: from averages of fifteen features per year in the 1970s to twenty-seven between 1981 and 1987.

The IOBA scheme underwrote a number of filmic successes, notably with the high-budget film, the financiers' preferred genre The eight topgrossing Australian films in the home market as at 1988 were all big-budget specThe Man from Snowy River (1982), Gallipoli (1981), Mad Max I (also known as The Road Warrior; 1981), Phar (1983), Thunderdome (1985).

The prevailing image of Australia vouchsafed by these successful blockbusters drew the bush myth. Aside from the losers of Gallipoli (Peter Weir; 1981) in which antipodean soldiers are sacrificed on the altar of the Empire, and of Phar Lap, the horse that is unstoppable until it goes to the USA, the Crocodiles and Snowys were Anglo Celtic men of the outback who tame the intractable land and usually the heroine, and instance those stereotypically old Australian values of mateship (a club for white males) and larrikinism (cocking asnook at (colonial) authority) while the Mad Maxes posited amalenarcissistic loner. That the settings remained non-urban testifies to the remarkable discursive tenacity of the bush myth in the world's second most urbanized nation--as well as to its overseas appeal. That heroes increasingly succeeded through this may testify to growing national confidence~or at least to film-makers more pre to invest in Hollywood assumptions.

The blockbuster policy; however, was not universally successful. The Coolangatta Gold (Igor Auzins 1984), for instance, was generic mishmash of youth, contest and running movie, domestic melodrama; rock musical, and love story; a film deploying genres as so many marketable of a blunderbuss .

The social realist genre continued to serve as Australia's the raw, street-wise Hard Knocks (Don McLennan, 1980) (Glenda Hambly, 1985) The genre crossbred in the 1980s with other genres to produce three of the best films of the period: blending with the musical in the engagingly energetic Starstruck (Gillian Armstrong; 1982), with melodrama in High Tide (Gillian Armstrong, 1987),a richly metaphoric  exploration of mother-daughter relationships, while Shame (Steve Jodrell, 1988) crossed social realism with the Western to produce very powerful account of rape and the law in an outback town.

In the 1980s the period film briefly crossbred with the war film in Breaker Morant and Gallipoli, where two of the country's most competent directors touched a nationalist nerve by  defining Australia positively against British

It was in the very low-budget feature and short film sectors, which rarely receive theatrical exhibition, that bolder issues and greater formal experimentation emerged. Supporting this vigorous independent sector in the 1980s were two divisions of the AFC, the Creative Development Branch (1978-90) and the Fund  (formalized in 1980, replaced by  the Women's Program 1987), which between them helped fund some 600 films and videos\_ In the of documentary with fictional registers frequently foregrounded sociallpolitical issues, with varying degrees of experimentalism, from the docudramas of Bill Bennett's social issue films such as A Street to Die (1985), on Agent dedramatize narrative by disintegrating it into quotidian episodes; as in With Love to the Person Next to Me (1987), Brian McKenzie's existential meditation on lonely Melbourne lives

Amongst short films in the independent sector in this period, women's films were the most consistently innovative. Two in particular make striking conceptual use of Brechtian techniques. Serious Undertakings (Helen Grace, 1983) urged a rewriting of Australian history and culture in terms of gender difference, and Nice   Coloured Girls relations between Aboriginal women and white  Australian men since white settlement.

## SINCE 1989: THE FFC PERIOD

The rise of economic rationalism among Treasury bureaucrats in the mid-1980s sharpened awareness drain on tax revenue. Its replacement, the Film Finance Corporation (FFC), was set up in 1988 as a film bank with initial annual funding of S7Om\_ to be gradually reduced in subsequent years, with the ideal scenario that it could eventually privatize itself out ofany need for government subsidy. As part of its commercial, deal-driven policy; the this has necessitated introducing some foreign actors, which has kept alive struggles between Actors' Equity and certain producers, notably over the casting of the American unknown Charlie Schlatter opposite Kylie Minogue in the Australian period-set The Delinquents (Chris Thomson, policy of sending scripts to Hollywood for vetting, the FFC films of its first four years at an average of S3.8m. each with up to 85 per cent FFC funding; and guaranteed distribution Australian companies specializing in overseas marketsfrom

Despite an apparent institutional entrenchment of disnationalist, low versus high budget with the separate significant   rapprochement between these formerly arized discursive sets. This has been largely due to a weakened position of advocates of higher-budgeted films. State subsidy of films dropped by 50 per cent and the FFC Film Fund's lower funding tier gave respectability to films budgeted around $3m. With Hollywood's poaching of all the major name directors in Australia, the high-budget film has lost many of its most influential advocates\_ The to Australia-Peter Weir, Bruce Beresford, Fred Schep isi, Phil Noyce, and George others have of the FFCs two or three highest-budgeted blockbusters (each costing around S13m.): Till there Was You (John Seale, 1989) was unreleased; Turtle Beach (Stephen Wallace 1992) (Yahoo Serious, 1993) gathered only a disappointing SSm. at the local boxoffice. The FFCs only high-budget boxoffice success has been Green Card (Peter Weir, 1991), a co production directed by an expatriate name director; and poling aspirant

As in any national cinema, coproductions are the joker inthe pack, confounding neat distinctions ofthehermetic fictions of national identity. This may be all to the in an era when cultural hybridity has more and more to be recognized as central to most people's lived experience Economically; of course, co-productions broaden an audience without increasing the costs in proportion. As in the case of Green Card , can reap a substantial profit which can be used to cross-subsidize other FFC films .

Local cultural rep resentations generally lose out to overseas stereotypes , as in the kangaroos conspicuously hopping in the fore ground of the British coproduction No Worries On the other hand film like Dingo (Rolf de Heer; 1992) succeeds in neither denigrating nor romanticizing its outback, nor lionizing its Paris jazz settings. good they

set overseas. The production slate has polarized into films above S6m. for the international market, but very few of the latter have been successful.

Meanwhile, the deregulatory atmosphere of the 1980s and 1990s has   encouraged the rapprochement between the cultural and commercial of the industry by uniting previously warring parties into pressuring government for continued funding and continued cultural protection measures. Film-makers have increasingly needed to seek funds from diverse sources-the AFC and FFC, subfederal support agencies such as Film Victoria, as well as pre-sales-and thus to be accountable to a broader range of interests than was usually the case under IOBA. late wings

These factors have generated greater cohesion within the industry; and have contributed to making this arguably the most successful phase of the revival. So, too, has the exodus of major name directors to Hollywood, which has opened glorious opportunities to less experienced degree of correlation between critical and box office success missing since before the critical apoplexies that greeted the ocker comedy. Most notably; Strictly Ballroom not only won a Cannes prize, but also was the most profitable film exhibited in Australia (relative to its S3.5m. production budget) in the financial year 1992-3 The Piano (Jane Campion, 1993), in which the AFC invested development reach way beyond a traditional art-film audience; probably not just on account ofits stars and its melodramatic force but also because local chauvinism combined with the cachet of a top award at Cannes.

More broadly cultural factors have also contributed to the period's success, notably a growing cultural maturity which has seen the country past Crocodile Dundee's monocultural mix of Anglo-Celtic outback male and fantasies of marrying into the US media. This has been made possible by a deeper sense of historical understanding than the period film could ever allow. This was enabled by such widely seen mini-series as The Dismissal (1983) and Vietnam (1987), which dealt with two major recent historical traumas: the 1975 dismissal ofGough Whitlam's reformist Labor government by Queen Elizabeth Il's representative

The FFC period's success can also be attributed to benefits accrued from twenty years of professional experiby-night quickies, many fine films of the subsequent era have been long in development: Celia (Ann Turner; 1989) for four years and Proof for six years, while Phobia (John Dingwall, 1990) went through sixteen rewrites. There has also been stress on on filmmakers directing their own scripts, policy which has off, most plainly with Proof and The Piano. paid

in Australia, the Governor General, and the involvement fighting for the USA in Vietnam.

As regards Aborigines, the best outcome ofthe chauvinist jamboree of 1988's Bicentennial (of white settlement) of Australia has been that it catalysed black resistance enough to advance Aboriginal land rights and blackwhite reconciliation Aboriginal film-makers are now making significant inroads into feature film production Building on the lead of such shorts as My Survival as an Aboriginal (Essie Coffey; 1979) and Nice Coloured Girls (Tracey Moffatt, 1987), 1993 has seen two blackdirected features , bold adaptation of an Aboriginalopera, and Bedevil (Tracey Moffatt, 1993),astartlingly studio-set adaptation of three ghost stories , as well as the gutsy social realist, white-directed Blackfellas (James Ricketson; 1993).

Other recent developments have urged the dominant national self towards reconciliation with its repressed female and black others. Feminist affirmative action policies have since the later 1980s achieved significant results in a previously strenuously male-dominated industry; the percentage of female directors in the feature industry rose from 6 per cent in 1985-6 to 23 per cent in 1990-1.Aclear majority ofthis phase's strongest films have been directed by women: Celia's beguiling historical fable about Cold War repressions, Sweetie's (1989, Jane Campion) quirkily arty inversion of the domestic melodrama; the engaging Tass, 1990), Proof, with its fascinating hypothesis of a blind man who takes photographs and its (unconsciouslambivalent?) endorsement of male bonding, Waiting's (Jackie McKimmie, 1991) witty comedy of manners, the mid-life crisis meditation of Last Days of Chez Nous (Gillian Armarguably, the feminist melodrama of The Pianowhich, with its Australian production base and crew, has been routinely claimed as Australian despite its French production finance, New Zealand-born director and lead Comparably strong male-directed films have been the polished social realist Return Home Argall, 1990), Phobia 1990), twohander of Strindbergian intensity on the psychodynamics of codependency; Flirting (John Duigan; 1991), with its sophisticated treatment a rural Australia isolated from world politics, Strictly Ballroom, one of the greater feelgood films, and Romper Stomper (Geoffrey Wright; 1992), the city Melbourne.

The first NFB Oscar came in 1941 for Churchill's Island. Part of a series of propaganda films, it was distinguished by the imaginative use of captured enemy footage and the genuinely uplifting sentiments conveyed by the first of many Lorne Greene voiceovers. Grierson's great energies and his capacity for mobilizing the talents of others had already begun to show. One of the young film-makers who had arrived in the early 1940s to join Grierson was fellow Scot Norman McLaren McLaren's experiments in camwhich he the resulted in animation classics like Hen (1942) and Begone Dull Care (1949). Later, McLaren pioneered his new pixillation technique (object animation) and in 1952 won an Oscar for his applied Hop

The early successes of the documentary and animation studios secured the NFB's future in terms of its film aesthetic and its continued 1960s the studios continued to flourish, developing the original Griersonian conception of film as social document to include lyrical forms of documentary like Colin Low's Corral (1954) and Pas de deux (1967), McLaren's romantic experimentation with dance the printer. The introduction oflightweight cameras and sound equip ment in the early 1960s, together with the influence of television, saw the beginning of the direct cinema move ment. Unit B, the documentary studio headed by Tom Daly,   responded vigorously to the technological revolution with The Candid Eye film series. Intimate portraits using direct sound   replaced the standard-issue information with voice over. Films from this period include Lonely (1961) the acclaimed study of the pop Terence Macartney-Filgate's The Back-Breaking Leaf (1959) about the working lives of the Ontario tobacco planters\_ using optical Boy

A further cause of discontent among the Quebécois film-makers was the lack of representation of their own culture in the films themselves. The appointment of Québécois Film Commissioner in 1957 and the victory ofthe Liberal party led by René Lévesque in the Province of Quebec in 1960, with its slogan of 'révolution tranquille changed the old patterns.

Many senior film administrators and producers and many of Canada's leading film-makers began their careers at the NFB. Indirectly the UK benefited too: Sydney Newman, the doyen of British television in the 1960s, and several generations of animators have followed Richard Williams (Who Framed Roger

The   technological advances that had made direct cinema possible were now used to celebrate Quebec and its distinctness Despite opposition; Groulx's film Les Raquetteurs was released and became a manifesto for other congress of the raquetteurs (snowshoes) clubs in 1958, Michel Brault's camera itself participant among the street celebrations and direct cinema-the roving camera, the refusal to enhance or idealize the subjects, the lack of commentary; the rejection of touristic or picturesque imagery, and the ideo logical rapport ofthe film-maker with his or her subjects \_ constituted directly political approach to film-making which the Québécois came to regard as their own invention. Of the many films subsequently made at the NFB in this way none stands out more than Pierre Perrault's Pour la suite du monde (1963), in which Perrault, with cameraman Michel Brault, recorded the annual beluga fishing tradition on the Île-aux-Coudres. Perrault's cinéma de parole' was development away from the cinema of simple observation to more immediate participation with the subjects and an emphasis on the importance of tra-people\_

of the Famous Players Corporation under the aegis of the Combines Investigation Act. But Famous Players were rimental to the public interest, and the motives for the investigation itself were unclear-was it culture Or commerce that was being protected? In truth, the case failed because the business practices which it investigated were merely the result of aggressive entre preneurial strategies. The underlying problem however, was not simply the aggressive distribution practices ofthe US companies, but the lack of Canadian films of either commercial or cultural value to compete in the market

On the one hand Canada became a branch plant of the American film industry and on the other it was exploited by the British as a compliant host for the notorious 'Quota quickies' . Ofthe thirteen feature films known to have been made in Canada in the 1930s no prints remain. During the 1940s and 1950s features were made inde pendently in Quebec but it was not until the 1960s that agenda.

Don Haldane made The Drylanders at the NFB in 1963 Based on experiences of drought and depression among the farming community on thc Canadian Prairics during the 1920s and rather mechanically followed NFB documentary precepts. The result is a downbeat realism without the freshness of the realist cinema then produced in the UK But other features Don Owen's Nobody Waved Goodbye thirty-page shooting script on lightweight cameras dealt in an improvised and spontaneous way with teenage disaffections . Less ponderous, and with more attitude than anything that had gone before, Nobody Waved Goodbye was a success in New York, breakthrough for Canadian theatrical releases . In the French studio, influenced by the French Nouvelle Vague; Gilles Groulx made Le Chat dans le sac (1964). More sophisticated than Owen's film in its attempts to confront issues of national identity and personal freedom, it was hailed instantly as cultural landmark for Québécois cinema. Gilles Carle's first feature; La Vie heureuse de Léopold 2, was begun as documentary short about snowclearing during the Montreal winter and became feature by default. Carles feature film-making career progressed throughout the much of his work, including La Mort dun bûcheron (1972) and LAnge et la Femme (1977), featuring the actress Carole Laure through whose sensual beauty Carle developed his imaginative style of film-making. being

## QUEBEC

In the 1970s Sydney Newman returned to Canada from the BBC to become Film Commissioner. Newman was the last non-French-speaking Commissioner to be appointed at the NFB and his tenure there coincided with militant phase of Quebec nationalism. During the late Gaulle's famous 'Vive le Québec Libre' speech of 1967,had become volatile The Parti québécois (PQJ, led by erstwhile liberal René Lévesque, was formed in 1968 and the Front de libération du Québec (FLQ) had stepped up their campaign of demonstrations and minor skirmishes\_ The situation became more serious when, in 1970, the FLQ kidnapped British commercial attaché and a Quebec minister. The minister was killed and the October Crisis began with Federal Government troops on the streets and the War Measures Act invoked. The political mishandling ofthis crisis by the ruling Liberal partyin Quebec involved hundreds of arrests and the suspension of basic human rights, paving the way for the PQvictory in 1976.

These were golden years at the NFB Quebec cinema. The films reflected, celebrated, documented\_ and dramatized the lives of the people. Michel Brault's Les Ordres (1974), which shared the director's prize at Cannes in 1975, stated the 'indépendentiste' case in its fictionalized for

est au coton (1970, released 1976)a documentary film about the employment conditions of Quebec textile workers, provoked scandalized reaction the NFB administration, who banned it on the grounds of inaccuracy. Undeterred, Arcand went on to make the political feature Réjeanne Padovani (1973), in which he explored the corrupt world of the Quebec power élite. Jean Pierre Lefebvre was midcareer with his slow-paced minimalist dramas: Les Dernières Fiançailles (1973), about the life of an elderly couple; and LAmour blessé (1975), about battered wife both resist what Lefebvre has called the 'cultural mercantilism' and the 'industrialized production' of the private sector. But perhaps the most affectionately remembered film from these years is Claude Jutra's second feature Mon oncle Antoine (1971), a nostalgic rites-ofpassage film set in small-town, priest-ridden, 1950s Quebec during a typically snowy Christmas. Jutra's exploration of local colour made Mon oncle Antoine a success in Quebec = linternationally; proving that the best national funny and

## CFDC AND TELEFILM CANADA

In 1968, after many years of deliberation, the Federal Government set up the Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC), the function of which was to stimulate production in the private sectorby investing public money in feature film projects\_ The legislation created a minigoldrush, with non-Canadian companies, especially from the States, every legal loophole to claim the Canadian taxpayer's money. With the addition of the 100 percent Capital Cost Allowance in 1974 and the new craze for making co-productions, the tax shelter years, as came to be known, were born. Few films stand out from the indifferent mass but some of the later co-productions with France did well at the boxoffice including Jeanand Louis Malle's Atlantic City USA (1980), in which Burt Lancaster plays an ageing petty crook rediscovering his Sutherland, is best forgotten. Two teen movies, Bob Clark's Porky's (1981) and Ivan Reitman's Meatballs (1979) with Bill Murray; became the grossing Canadian movies of all time but were spurned as unworthy by critics in Canada For director Ted Kotcheff the CFCD enabled him to return to Canada from successful directing career in the UK to make The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974). But Kotcheff he subsequently made the first and best of the Rambo series , First Blood, in 1982. they top

This time the protectionist policies were directed specifically at television which 20 per cent audience share (above 5 million viewers) constituted top ratings, revenue from advertising was Canadian television drama might cost as much as the acquisition of several hours of similar American gramming. If broadcast franchises were to be awarded on the basis of Canadian content then there had to be sufficient Canadian programming being made in the first place.

In the mid-1980s Telefilm Canada's mandate was extended to feature films and the Film Fund was set up with producers' access coming through distribution advance rather than broadcast commission. The year the release of the three most significant Canadian films of this period: Patricia Rozema's Ive Heard the Mermaids Singing, Denys Arcand's The Decline of the American Empire, and Atom Egoyan's Family Viewing.

Meanwhile the NFB was also producing low-budget feature films which addressed contemporary Canadian issues. Giles Walker's 90 Days (1985) and John M.

## ANIMATION

Throughout this period the NFB continued to produce a solid body of quality documentary films which were sold to around the world. However , perhaps the NFB's greatest achievements have been in the field of animation. McLaren died in 1987 but his commitment to innovation and experiment lived on. Caroline Leaf joined the NFB in the early 1970s from the United States  where she had made award-winning animations using sand on glass. Leaf used the same technique to tell an ancient Inuit legend in the 1974 The Owl Who Married a Goose, but to make The Street (1976) she used paint on glass to to the screen. When the Los Angeles Animation Olympics were judged by fifty-strong panel of international film-makers and critics Tales. After a break from animation Leaf returned to make Two Sisters in the NFB French Animation Studio in 1990. Leaf spent a year and a half scratching directly on the 70 mm. film, the depth of the etching revealing the layers of colour beneath the emulsion Two Sisters went on to win more than ten international awards story

Over the years the NFB has played host to many internationally renowned animators who have worked in a vast variety of techniques and styles These influences have been absorbed into the NFB animation culture, ensuring that every year the work of both the French and English studios is represented at international festivals and animation events NFB guest animators have included Alexander Alexeieff and Claire Parker, inventors of the pinscreeen technique famously used in their 1933 Night on a Bare Mountain. At the NFB Alexeieff and Parker set up second pinscreen, which was used by Jacques Drouin to make his award-winning Mindscape in 1976. Other animators like Paul Driessen and Co Hoedeman from Holland Caroline Leaf from the United States and Ishu Patel from India have spent much of their working lives in animation at the NFB, where their films have won numerous prizes . Recent award-winners include Richard Condie and Cordell Barker whose humorous animation, in The Snit (1985) and The Cat Came Back (1988) respectFine, now permanently based in the UK, were Oscar nominated for George and Rosemary (1987), masterpiece of comic framing and timing.

## THE EXPERIMENTAL FILM

Yet another source of public funding is available through the Canadian Council and its provincial equivalents for artist film-makers\_ Through this source system of co: operative schemes and distribution centres and their client base is maintained\_ Best known of the Canadian experimental film-makers is Michael Snow; whose work in the 1960s and 1970s influenced a generation of structural film-making. His short film Wavelength (1967) is a crucial text in the avant-garde lexicon and established his international   reputation. Snow's concerns centre on the camera and its position vis-à-vis the subject, both the seeing subject (the audience) and the filmic subject.

Subsequent   generations of Canadian experimental film-makers have produced work of international repute. On the west coast David Rimmer, also working in the structural tradition, often with found footage, has been

Canadian experimental film owes little to the painterly traditions of its colonial antecedents and eschews the Canadian landscape. Unlike the British landscape, which has fused with consciously lyrical and romantic tradition in all the art-forms since the mideighteenth century; the Canadian landscape is a wild and awful presence prompting Michael Snow to attack it (and the viewer) in La Région Centrale (1971) with an angrily moving camera But for the most part experimental and underground filmand addresses itself to the more contemporary; urban issues of ethnicity and sexuality.

## New Cinemas in Latin America

In the late 1950s a new cinema began to appear in Latin America, carving out spaces for itself wherever it found theslightestchance, growing upeven in the most inimical circumstances; indeed thriving upon them, for this was a cinema largely devoted to the denunciation of misery and the celebration of protest. In the space of ten or fifteen years, movement developed which not only reached from one end of the continent to the other, but brought the cinema in Latin America to world-wide attention for in different countries, ranging the Documentary Film School of Santa Fe in Argentina and the emergence recent history of Latin America. In Argentina and Brazil , growth and retrenchment have corresponded to the wax and wane of democracy. Cuban cinema is synonymous with the Cuban Revolution; Chilean cinema is another name for Popular Unity movement which elected Salvador Allende Ten years later came from

idea ofmilitant cinema which first developed in the 1960s, the decade of Che Guevara.

Some of the earliest initiatives occurred in outof-the way places, like Cuzco in Peru, where film club was set upin 1955 and Manuel Chambi and others started making short documentaries on ethnographic and socio-cultural themes The 1950s saw the spread of societies throughout the continent, the   proliferation of filmmaking courses and contests, and the publication ofmagazines. It was in the pages of titles like Hablemos de cine in Peru and Cine al día in Venezuela that in the 1960s and 1970s the movement debated its values and sense ofidentity

Many of these groups were linked to social movements, like the cultural club Nuestro Tiempo run by the Communists in Havana in the early 1950s, which harboured several future Cuban directors\_ The first international meeting-place for the young film-makers was film festival in Montevideo set up in 1954 by the SODRE, Uruguay's national radio station and progressive cultural promoter.Among the film-makers attending in 1958, Young

## BRAZIL AND CINEMA NOVO

Several pioneers of the new Latin American cinema had studied film in Rome in the early 1950s, and, returning home, adopted the neo-realist principles of documentary style location shooting with non-professional actors as the only practical solution for their situation But and others also took up neo-realism because saw it as critical aesthetic. As Birri explained, in Italy neo-realism was the cinema that discovered , amidst the rhetoric and outward show of development, another Italy, the Italy of underdevelopment. It was a cinema of the humble and the offended which Latin America cried out for. they they

film-maker Nelson Pereira dos Santos carried the spirit of neo-realism deeper into new territory with a stark adap tation of a novel by Graciliano Ramos about the appalling conditions in rural northeast Brazil, zone of underdevelopment within underdevelopment. The same aesthetic and the same locale served Guerra for Os fuzis a drama of hunger in the sertão and violent confrontation between soldiers and peasants, while Carlos Diegues made Ganga Zumba, the story of the seventeenth-century maroon community of Palmares and thus the first film of Cinema Novo to tackle a historical theme.

allegorical quality which becomes a distinctive trait of the entire movement: the to speak of subjects on more than one level at the same time, of the present while politics while talking of religion. At the same time the exploration of these themes quickly left the aesthetic ofneo-realism behind, as directors and cinematographers sought to create a visual style which matched the legendary   qualities of the films , Xica de Silva in 1976 and Quilombo in 1984, which show striking progression from the sober black and white narrative of Ganga Zumba to the vivid colour, visual tropicalism; or at least one of its variants, which borrows directly from the carnivalesque at the heart of Brazilian culture. The first of these films recounts the rise and fall of an eighteenth-century slave   possessed of the second revisits the Palmares story, incorporating the results of new historical research. But Diegues is less concerned with objective narrative than with transposing to the screen the ritualistic forms through which Afro Brazilian culture itself recounts its history and the narrative form of these films is first cousin to the performances of the samba schools Meanwhile Nelson Pereira dos Santos pursued his own highly original brand of allegory in films like 0 amuleto de Ogum (The amulet of Ogum' , mythology effects parody of the thriller. For other sub jects, however he retains realist approach, as in the masterful Memorias do carcere ('Memories of prison'), an adaptation autobiographical novel by Craciliano Ramos about political repression, which won the Critics Prize at Cannes in 1984 ability popular

## Glauber Rocha (1938-1981)

Glauber Rocha was the shooting star ofBrazilian cinema, and the enfant terrlble of the Cinema Novo of the 1960s.

The leading figure of a new cinema that was made, as he himself put it, with 'an idea in the head and a camera in hand' nity, gorical

In his 1965 manifesto Rocha argued that the originality of Cinema Novo in its revelation that 'violence is normal behaviour for the 'the moment of violence is the moment when the colonizer becomes aware of the existence of the colonized' . Accordingly the aesthetics of hunger are directed against the values ofthe cinema ofimperialism and in Rocha's hands the result is a style which eschews narrative clarity in favour ofviolent expressive imagery. lay

Combining the intellectual infuence of the French polltique des auteurs and the thinking of Che Guevara and Frantz Fanon, stylistically speaking Rocha's work bears case this is partly Brechtian and partly ritualistic, inspired by Afro-Brazilian religion.

The Cuban regime, however; enjoyed widespread support amongst artists and intellectuals, to whom, with the creation of institutions it offered conditions which the country had never before enjoyed. ICAIC succeeded first of all in economic terms: a studio with control over distribution and a staff of 1,000, producing each year (until the country's economic collapse at the end of the as many as four dozen documentaries, all for an annual production budget of around $10 million or less than half the price of a single Hollywood blockbuster: Communist egalitarianism and the absence of market competition combined to hold the costs of production down, enabling a cinema of poverty to flourish.

## THE CUBAN EXAMPLE

Cuba was America where it to envisage new film culture both popular and critical, of the kind imagined by Birri, on a national scale\_ Cinema was second only to music as the country's most popular form of entertainment when the revolutionary governmentof 1959 decreed the creation of and Industry), to take control of the movie business and become   responsible for   production and distribution Under the leadership of Alfredo Guevara (no relation to Che but close political comrade of Fidel Castro) ICAIC most successful venture of its kind, bar one anywhere on the continent, intervention in the film industry. The exception, by histhe return to democracy in the 1980s and was disbanded in 1990.

Embrafilme was political contradiction: created to advertise the Brazilian military miracle abroad, it ended up funding film-makers who, as Pereira dos Santos expressed it, were   'viscerally opposed to such regimes'\_

ICAIC also succeeded in artistic terms\_ The popularity of cinema in Cuba (television had been introduced in 1951 but reached only limited audience until the 1970s) meant that ICAIC was rapidly catapulted to the took the road of Communism, Alfredo Guevara led the film-makers in arguing passionately against the narrow and restrictive orthodox ideology of Socialist Realism, and in favour of stylistic pluralism and artistic freedom. A few individuals; among them cinematographer Nestor AImen called foul and departed; but left behind growing community of film-makers who began to feed each other's enthusiasms. Aesthetically the most   audacious was Santiago Alvarez, who headed ICAICs newsreel unit, which he turned into a school for militant documentary. Progressing from short films like (1965), Hanoi martes 13 Hanoi, Tuesday the 13th', shot in Vietnam in 1967), and LBJ (1968), to long documentaries like Piedra sobre 'Stone upon stone') and De América soy hijo a son of America') shot in Peru in 1970 and Chile in 1972 respectively-he commandeered every reportage ofwar and peace. Employing everykindofvisual imagery; from newsreel footage to stills, archive film to cuttings from magazines; combined with animated texts and emblematic musicalization, Alvarez   amalgamated creative kleptomania with the skills of a bricoleur to reinvent Soviet montage in Caribbean setting. huge they off Now piedra

Cuban cinema was a major influence throughout the continent, although, because of the monopoly of the major distributors, less sowith audiences than with film-makers , who were able to travel and encounter the films and each other at festivals and example; animated a stream of films which attested to the conditions of life from Chihuahua to Tierra del Fuego. New paradigms of political documentary cinema appeared, combining the techniques of French cinémavérité and North from the Brazilian Geraldo Sarno's Viramundo of 1964 to Chircales by theColombian documentarists Marta Rodríguez and Jorge Silva in 1972, Paul Leduc's Etnocidio: notas sobre Mezquital ('Ethnocide: notes on Mezquital' , 1976), or Ciro Durán's of peasants from the drought-stricken north-east of Brazil to São Paulo, set new standard for socially engaged

At the same time, documentary realism also inspired films of fiction like Leon Hirszman's São Bernardo (1972), an allegory on the Brazilian miracle (and another adaptation of a novel by Ramos). Held back by the censorship board just enough to bankrupt the ous films which have been banned for political offence in every country of the continent at one time or another. King

Nevertheless, the experienceof exhibiting the film to peasant audiences prompted Sanjinés to question the efficacy of the style were working in: Ukamau and Blood of the Condor still portrayed the protagonists as individuals. In El coraje del pueblo ('The courageofthe people' , 1971), the reconstruction ofa massacre of miners in the town of Siglo XX in 1967, the pro tagonist is collective. The complex narrative built around flashbacks employed in Blood of the Condor is abandoned in favour of linear structure and tendency towards sequence shots.

In Chile; the new film-makers came together during the 1960s to support the coalition of left-wing parties known as Popular Unity. The years leading up to the electoral victory of Salvador Allende in 1970 saw a newwave in both fiction and documentary The essays of the Experimental Film Group of the 1950s turned into a cinema of urgency, which combined political campaign flms with innovation in filmic technique and language to denounce the marginalism inherent in underdevelopment. The same spirit fed a crop of features which appeared in the late 1960s, including Tres tristes tigres 'Three sad tigers' , 1968) by Raúl Ruiz, an experimental sociopolitical comedy; Valparaiso mi amor ('Valparaiso my love' 1969) by Aldo Francia (the moving spirit behind the festival in Viña del Mar in 1967), lyrical neo-realist drama of deprived children; and The Jackal of Nahueltoro (El chacal de Nahueltoro; 1969) by Miguel Littin, an agitated deconstruction of criminality; the last two are based on real incidents and characters

Attempts to place this activity on a more secure footing were cut short by the infamous coup of 1973 The most extraordinarv film to emerge from the latter part of this period is Patricio Guzmán's three-part documentary The Battle of Chile (La batalla de Chile, 1975), a record of the months leading up to the coup. A fertile mixture of direct cinema observation and investigative reportage, the footage was smuggled out immediately after Allende's fall and edited in Cuba at ICAlC. The result is a poignant work of historical testimony unique in the annals of cinema

Thanks to international solidarity, Chileans became the leading practitioners of cinema of exile which grew up in the 1970s (according to one count, they made 176 films in the ten years 1973-83, other films, he made Actas de Marusia ('Letters from Marusia', 1975), with the Italian actor Gian Maria Volonté and music by Mikis Theodorakis, in which the coup of 1973 is allegorized in the story of a massacre of miners in Chile in 1907.Nevertheless; the politicalimperatives ofthe Popular underwent a gradual transformation, as the overtly militant gave way to a more personal and ironic stanceespecially in the impish work of Raúl Ruiz, now one of the leading figures of European avant-garde cinema At the took the experience of exile as their subject-matter. The first of them, Ruiz's semi-documen Dialogo de exilados ('Dialogue of exiles' , 1974), was badly received in the exile community for its ironic, disrespectful portrait of life in exile. But later films, like Marilu Mallet's highly personal documentary Journal inachevé (Unfinished diary' , 1982) and Jorge Durán's dramatic featureA cor de seu destino The colour of his destiny' , 1986) made in Canada and Brazil respectively; are remarkable expositions ofthe struggle to understand the exile's sense of extraordinary film of exile is Tangos: el exilio de Gardel (Tangos: the exile of Gardel' , 1985) by the Argentinian Fernando Solanas, an experimental musical set among the Argentine exile community in Paris. they period tary

## INTO THE 1980s

The transformation of political thematics was not limited to the cinema of exile. Cuban directors during the 1970s developed a new brand of genre cinema, in films like El Negro (Manuel Pérez, 1973 and 1977): macho adventure movies in which the guys are revolutionaries and the bad guys counter-revolutionaries. A growing trend in the 1980s towards social comedy; marked by two films of good

In Venezuela for example, Roman Chalbaud evolved new politically edged forms of old Latin American genres in flms like El pez que fuma ('The smoking fish' , 1977), which turns the world of the Mexican brothel film into a (1982), which turns the thriller into a denunciation of police corruption Not always artistically successful, nevertheless achieved top boxoffice in their own countries, outgrossing all but the biggest Hollywood hits\_ Only US monopolization ofinternational distribution prethe time ICAlC launched the Havana Film Festival in 1979, it seemed at last as if a critical, national popular cinema was more than a dream in several countries\_ they

The 1980s saw an assortment of developments includthe renaissance of Argentinian cinema, the emergence of a women 's cinema in a number of different countries (especially Mexico and Brazil) , the revival of the Mexican film industry; and alternatives like the Super 8 movement in Venezuela. With the expanding variety of all these films, both aesthetically and politically; the idea ofa movement generated in the 1960s, even one that was unified in its diversity, began to recede But if the distinction between commercial cinema and committed cinema became blurred, it was mainly because of the recognition of different political realities The tradition of comtors like Mexico's Paul Leduc, in films like Frida (1984) and Dollar Mambo (1993). Discarding linear narrative in favour of mobile imagery the former portrays the life and loves , painting and politics of Frida Kahlo as a series of interlocking and visually intoxicating tableaux vivants; while the latter tells the story of the US invasion of Panama in 1989 in the form of a wordless dance drama. Frida was the producer of two of Buñuel's finest Mexican films (Los olvidados (The forgotten') and The Exterminating Angel) , and Jaime Humberto Hermosillo, better known as a director; and Mexico's with films  like the banned Las aparencias engañan (Appearances deceive 1977) and Dona Herlinda y su hijo (Doña Herlinda and her son' , 1984) ing

## CONCLUSION

## New Concepts of Cinema

which it was discussed and written about. In the 1960s and 1970s there was a revolution in flm criticism and went on to affect both journalistic and academic writing on the cinema and to influence many aspects of film-stream\_

Like any such revolution, its effects were only partially irreversible. The bolder insights of the new writing failed to find general acceptance, while many originally radical ideas became routinized and academicized with the spread of film studies in the universities and the dwininteraction between academic study world outside. dling

To make sense of the revolution it is perhaps convenient to divide it into number of distinct but overlapping ible either to build on its achievements or to reject its limitations and head off a new direction Events did not always   precisely follow the order suggested here, and but division into three or four stages demonstrates a certain logic in what, at the time, seemed very confusing set of developments . poss-

The first stage, beginning in the early 1960s, involved a general revaluation of the artistic values of mainstream cinema, and Hollywood in particular, stressing the contribution of individual auteurs and greatly extending the boundaries ofwhat could be regarded as film art:. This was followed, in the late 1960s and early 1970s, by a Marxistinfluenced critique of that same cinema, downplaying the role of individual artists and the cinema as a cracked ideological monolith, in which the cracks, interthough were never seemed sufficient to challenge the general ideological character of cinema as whole. Analysis of the ideological operations of cinema then in turn produced two contrasting developments. Acceptance of the ideological critique led to ideas of a 'countercinema and of subversive practices within the mainstream, as a wayofescaping the 'Hollywood-Mosfilm' monolith. ingly came to assert that the fissures were after all more important than the monolith and that the reception of seeing esting they

films was a more complex and openended process than the ideological critics maintained.

## BEFORE THE REVOLUTION

1950s consisted of barely re-examined assumptions about film art inherited from the aesthetics of the silent period. The core of this theory was notion of filmic specificity through montage\_ The main difference of opinion concerned the status given to the photographic image. Some writers   (and film-makers) saw it as inherently manwhich it could be transformed to produce new meanings and effects, while others located the specific difference of film in its subordination captured by the camera. Sound was seen as having added additional possibilities of counterpoint to basic imagistic cinema fulfl its inherent vocation for realism Film theory was also very much oriented towards art practice, and to the idea of making flms, in some nebulous way, mote artistic. Emphasis was put on the effects the film-maker of them\_

## REVALUATION OF THE MAINSTREAM

Film films which were either self-consciously artistic or which used the supposed realism of the photographic image to psychological or social effect. It had relatively little to say neither conspicuously arty nor systematically realistic. Critics admired Welles and Ford minger Since individuality was prized, and the studio system was thought to value repetition and formula over originality, the qualities of genre films were often overlooked. A first stage in the critical and theoretical revolution, therefore, consisted in the affirmation of genre films in general and of directors working within genre framework which disciplined and channelled their individuality With this came a recognition ofon the one hand the thematic richness of the Hollywood movie in general theory

to be found in the work of a number of studio directors with no obvious artistic pretensions\_ It was not long, limits within the system, not only to individuality; but to the range of ideas that could be expressed . The delirious over-valuations and over-interpretations found in Cahiers du cinéma, Movie, and other magazines gave way to more sober assessments of what Hollywood directors could and could not achieve

## MARXISM

seminal article 'Tales of Sound and Fury' , published in the British   magazine   Monogram in 1972, Thomas Elsaesser attempted to integrate the acquisitions of the new criticism in broader intellectual framework and to was shaped by prevailing ideological assumptions, including the assimilation of Freud. By this time, however; Cahiers du cinéma had itself moved on and come under the influence of Marxist, psychoanalytic, and structuralist thought, while politically radicalized by the 1968 The new influences surfaced in Britain in the magazine Screen from 1974 onwards, spread from there to the United States where crystallized being May ing

The Cahiers Screen writers saw the cinema in general bourgeois ideology; both in its content and in its form. But unlike some Marxists, before Or since, were less interested in denouncing it than in exploring its contradictions and the complex articulations between economic determinations and the actual construction of meaning within the film. In their now famous analysis of Cahiers stressed the way the film does not hold together as pure expression ofideology\_whether as intended by the studio or in more general terms dictated by the crisis and its attempted restructuring under Roosevelt's Deal. On the connot only are there contradictions ofFord himself as director, but the way the film constructs meaning precludes any automatic translation of an ideological   project into cinematic terms Meaning in the cinema is both more complex and more precarious than straightforward Marxist interpretations make it out to be It also has more to do with the way the film engages the spectator as subject than with the content as such they New

## PSYCHOANALYSIS

To account for the way films engage the spectator; the Cahiers Screen writers turned to psychoanalysis , and

specifically to the reading of Freud proposed by the French writer Jacques Lacan But whereas the choice of par mainly positive effects on the critical enterprise because Althusser specifically denied the selfsufficiency of Marxism and called instead for inputs from outside, the choice of Lacan was more controversial. Lacan is a notoriously difficult writer and the nature ofhis difference from orthodox schools of psychoanalysis is often obscure cally what film theorists got from Lacan, and would not have got from elsewhere, was a sense of the elusiveness of the knowing and perceiving subject and of the way the subject is constituted by its instinctual drives on the one hand and by its relation to the meanings offered to it by language and the structure of vision on the other. From this film theory formed the idea of a viewing subject positioned by the cinematic apparatus and anisms such as cross-cutting and the pointofview shot and thus bound into a particular way of reading the film and not only was the film itself 'bourgeois ideology' \_ but the manner in which it put itself across to the spectator forced him to assume a restrictive range of positions, often apparently either neurotic or perverse. In practice, however; just as ideology was fissured and contradictory and expressed differently from film to film, so different films and film styles opened up a wide range of possible spectator positions. While Sternberg's films, for example might impose on spectators regardless of gender a fetishistic experiencing of the female body, this was less true of cutting in the majority of films might bind the spectator into an involuntary identification with the protagonists , son 's films, which do not use a shotlreverse-shot structure, was therefore possible, from Lacanian position, both to criticize the ideological workings of cinema and to propose alternatives. specific being

If Lacanian psychoanalysis offered theory of how the shown that films were vehicle of meaning in the first place. While it is obvious enough that films convey some meaning to their spectators, it is by no means so sure that operate as a structured set of significations which can be analysed with the precision applied by linguists to verbal language. A crucial step in the direction of a quasi-linguistic understanding of cinema came with the publication of Roland Barthes's Elements of Semiology in 1964. Following a line of thought first expressed by the the century, Barthes proposed that verbal language was they

only a special case (albeit a privileged one) of signifying codes used to communicate meaning. The idea of treating the cinema as language had been put forward in the 1920s and 1930s, but had foundered on the difficulty-and sometimes absurdity\_of assigning specific grammatical values to cinematic devices (a cut being like a comma or a fade like semicolon, etc.) What Barthes argued was that the analogy and other municative Or signifying systems operated mainly at the tured communication\_ At this level it was necessary only be put in a certain position in a communication, and an order; or syntax, in which was conveyed-whether for example by denotation or connotation; by conventional symbols OI by iconic resemblanceswould depend on specific   properties of the system in question

Barthes's semiology can be seen as part ofa wider structuralist   enterprise; associated with the name of the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, which treated human culture as a whole-from myth, to poetry; to fashion-in terms of underlying structures of meaning. This was to its influence on film theory in the 1960s, particularly in the analysis of genres like the Western. But the main application of semiology (or semiotics; as it later came to be called) was the attempt, initiated by Christian Metz, to map the signifying features of the cinema-its use of images, the spoken and written word, music, and natural sound-in as exhaustive and scientific manner as possible Judged by the standards of linguistics the enterprise was never more than a partialsuccess. The fluid andmultiform character of film 'language" and the difficulty of pinning down the basic units with which it operates. meant that the results achieved were at best only provisional. Many would-be practitioners have therefore withdrawn from the systematic pursuit of semiotics analogous with linguistics into an alternative discipline known as pragmatics , which deals with less structured and more context-determined forms of communication:. have

In spite of these disappointments however, semiotics has had a real impact on writing about cinema; not just on film theory but on regular critical discourse as well. One of its effects has been to draw attention to the potential for   meaning contained in details and gesture, and becauseit does so analytically, from the point of view of the spectator reading the film, rather than from the point of view of the film's makers, it has proved particularly applicable to the decoding of the routinized communications prevalent on television Meanwhile very failure to locate the elusive minimum units of film language encouraged a focus on the larger units of filmic construction; and particularly the analysis of narrative The basic structuralist and semiotic ideas (derived in this its

linguistics but from the Russian Formalism of the 1920s) on how meaning is articulated by narrative have proved particularly useful in elucidating the structures (often strongly Oedipal) underlying many forms of popular narrative, from Bambi to North by Northwest to Star Wars. deep

## COUNTER-CINEMA

The idea that the in much the same way, binding the spectator to a particular constellation of   ideologically determined meanings , helped to accelerate the search for the terms of a countercinema which could communicate different meanings and offer the spectator wider range of positions from which to assess them A key influence here was the epic theatre of Bertolt Brecht, which to attract the spectator by means which avoided any form of identito Brecht's practice was the idea that the spectator should never lose the sense of present at spectacle, watching and listening to actors performing in a theatrical space. Just as Brecht had argued an 'estrangement (Verfremdung) between the actor and the audience, similar form of 'making strange' (in Russian, ostranenie) in art and literature sometimes   seeing it as distinguishing feature of art in general and sometimes as an effect to be aimed for. being for

Picking up on makers and film theorists in the late 1960s attempted to elaborate set of procedures which would enable the cinema to address the audience in non-mystifying way: the implications of what they were doing were spelt out in writings such as Peter Wollen's Counter-cinema: Vent d'est' (1972). which took one of Godard's most challenging films and both enumerated the procedures it used and offered Wollen found much that was  exemplary in Vent notably its consistent refusal to draw the spectator into a pretence that the spectacle watched was real and therefore to be taken expression of truth, he also and his refusal to offer alternative pleasures to those of identification. Unfortunately these and similar warnings went unheeded by some of the succeeding generation of critics and film-makers , whose concern to resist the which denied any form of pleasurable involvement on the part of the audience.

## FEMINISM

Probably the most productive uses of the new theory were those made by feminism. For a while criticism of mainstream cinema by feminists (together with parallel criticism from ethnic and sexual minorities) concentrated on obvious like the negative stereotyping of women characters and images of women as dumb blondes, hoydens, harridans-all seen as ways of putting women in their place in patriarchal society. But it soon came to be position in society and the way that this was variously mirrored and reinforced in particular films. Feminist argued that the cinema as whole was far more PrO foundly unequal in its representation of women and of sexual   relations It was not just that the majority of films took the form of heterosexual romance with narrative resolution that put the woman in her place classic literature) Rather the means of representation produced pattern of identification in which mas-dominated\_ Action was identified with masculinity; and women's bodies were spectacularized as the object of  the male gaze and male procedure so prevalent and insistent that it overpowered offered by the creation of  strong female characters or narrative resolutions in which the woman wins through undefeated. things

This position had implications not only for the reading of mainstream cinema but also for feminist film-making and the idea of a feminist counter cinema. The issue here was complicated by the realization thatit was not enough to evade fiction (and its attendant dangers of spectacularization) in favour of fact. The factual, overlaid by conventions that had conspired to make women invisible throughout history. Unpicking historical representation became as important for film-makers as resisting the lures of fiction. Women film-makers tended, however; to be more accommodating to their audiences than some of their male counterparts and the political need to find allies generally prevailed over impulse to bludgeon spectators into accepting the artist's ideas of what constituted suitably deconstructive work docuany

the pleasures that women draw from cinema became the main object of attention. This led to a more sympathetic treatment of melodrama and the women's picture and a recognition that the masquerade of femininity wide spread in the cinema is not purely negative phenomenon. In feminist film   theory; as elsewhere , more emphasis came to be put on what audiences read between the lines, Or against the grain, and less on the ideological

structuring that assigns women and femininity to a seemingly inevitable subordination.

## QUEERNESS AND TRANSGRESSION

Flow and containment, frustration and satisfaction, are essential elements of musical form, and narrative theory has maintained that all narrative proceeds by ment from order to disorder and then to new order established. The content of narrative has also been traditionally seen as thechannelling andshaping of desire in the interests of social cohesion, with couple formation, marriage; and reproduction as the explicitor implicit goal ofstories the world over; and incest and homosexuality as the threats to be contained Or warded off. long

## RECEPTION

The proponents of queer cinema are not alone in stressing the importance of audiences in deciding what the film meant for them. Feminist critics had already argued that the positioning ofthe femalespectator was by no means as fixed as someof the 'structuralist' writers had maintained while attempts to denounce the reactionary and racist stereotyping of Hollywood films such lone 's Rambo series have often run foul of the fact that sections of the audience which seem to be negatively stereotyped have nevertheless developed their own way of discounting this stereotyping and enjoying the film. This ability of audiences to determine their own readings of drawing support the more fluid theories of meaning associated with 'post-modern~ thinkers like Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard as well as from empirically based audience studies which showed wide differences in understanding between different components of the mass audience. Meanwhile audiences themselves have become increasingly segmented and; far more than in theclassical period, films which aspire 'to mass appeal to allow for all sorts of differential reading by spectators. In this respect the cinema has become post-modern because the from have

audience has made it so, with films like The Last Action Hero (1993) deliberately playing on audiences' preparedness to switch from one mode of reception to another:

## FILM STUDIES AND THE CANON

With the expansion of higher education and the estab lishment of a new discipline of film studies, the locus of serious and scholarly writing has tended to shift away structured environment of the universities. This has been a mixed history has become both more sophisticated and better Not only have film historians enjoyed fuller opportunities to practise their craft but they have been able to draw on intellectual developments in related disciplines  such perspectives , supported by detailed work on a wide of sources, mean that the place of cinema in twentiethcentury culture and in the world capitalist economy is much better understood than it was twenty or years ago variety thirty

On the critical front, however; the situation is confused Many of the film-theoretical revolutionaries of the 1970s were actively hostile to the idea of film criticism understood as a form of knowledgeable but subjective response to films, aiming to replace it by more refined and rigorous forms of film analysis. In the event; the practice of film criticism is in a state of general decline, but more because of the reluctance of literary editors of magazines to allow of the cogency of the attacks on it. Meanwhile academic writing on films has become somewhat cocooned and obsessed with problems which (for all their claims to be political) have little influence on the world outside the cinema itself. Compared with, say, the 1960s, relatively few films are produced (or at any released) which seem to require the attentive aesthetic analysis given in its to classic Hollywood or to European, Japanese, or Indian art cinema. If the mechanisms by which films form perception become stale, and films which change perception have become rare, it is not surprising if the practice of film criticism has given way to breathless journalism on the one side and to academic nit-picking on the other. being day have

The problem is compounded by the absence of a sense of canonical values. Up to 1960 there was a general agree ment on what values were important and which films and film-makers best expressed them. The auteurist critics of canon of established values-putting Hawks above Ford, Rossellini above De Sica, Mizoguchi above Kurosawa, etc. not to abolish the idea entirely. Subsequent writers have been suspicious of all forms of film canon, sometimes

because their personal tastes took them in bizarre and definitely noncanonical directions, sometimes because they argued that the idea of a canon was by definition dangerously élitist.

This creates proper under standing of cinema. First, a canon continues to exist-but by default and determined more by the vagaries of fashion and the accidents of availability than by any form of reasoned argument. Secondly, in default of such argument the idea ofthe importance ofcinema itselfis undermined. If any film can be as important as any other; and if quasihistorical or idiosyncratically personal judgements take the place of aesthetic reasoning, it is open to anyone to challenge the purpose of taking films seriously in the first place There has to be has achieved over the past hundred years, and where to look to find the evidence ofits achievement. This achievement having spoken in one way to audiences at one time, can pose new challenges to judgement now and in the future.

No canon, however; can be eternally fixed nor should a film canon be allowed to degenerate, as the literary canon has tended to do, into an invocation of lists of authors posedly beyond challenge Fortunately in the case of cinema this is unlikely to happen. For a start film studies has convincingly established the argument that cinema's that many works, particularly in the classic Hollywood key

At various times and in various parts of the world since the 1960s it has often seemed as if the cinema was in state of irreversible decline The evidence was there in the form of dwindling attendances, less variety of films to be seen, and-most visibly\_in the sad sight of former picture palaces boarded up; demolished to make way for parking lots, or converted to use as halls, bowling Or warehouses.

## THE CHANGING PATTERN OF EXHIBITION

To start with the most obvious signs of the cinema's reputed decline: it is certainly true that the number of theatres has been dwindling, particularly in the inner cities and (most sadly) in many small and even mediumsized towns which now have no cinemas at all.

But the multi-screen cinemas at least offer some both choice and comfort have been increased now that Europe has belatedly followed the US example and new multiplexes   have been opened in suburban locations Some of these are quite spectacular; and offer an enormous choice of films on taurants and other leisure facilities. At Kinepolis in sample week in early 1995, twenty-six different films were shown spread over twentyeight screens (the only duplication being due to was on show in warzenegger vehicle; Junior , was on in both English and French) being King

of the multiplexes suggests that the decline in cinema-going has been at least partly due, not were and offered inadequatefacilities . Current indications are that the fall in box-office which

was almost universal throughout the western world in the 1970s and 1980s has been stemmed. In Britain, where audiences in 1984 had dipped to 50 million (less than one visit to the cinema per year per member of the population), they have now gone back to around the 100 million mark; in other countries where the decline came later it seems to have bottomed out, while in the United States have been remarkably stable for number of years .

A more disquieting phenomenon from European and indeed world perspective (though its significance can easily be misinterpreted) is the growing dominance exhibition venues. The chief losers in the changing pattern of cinema exhibition have been old films (and the second- and third-run cinemas where used to be shown) and foreign films. As the attached figures show (Tables 1 and 2), American films have now captured some 80 per cent of the market in most western European countries, with the rest of the market taken up by indigenous films and only a negligible share going to films from other European non-European countries. With the opening up of the market in eastern Europe the they being

pattern there is somewhat similar. In Asia the situation films maintain presence, and indigenous industries remain strong in countries such as 'rationalization of the market in favour mainly of Hollywood films is in progress and its effects cannot be long delayed.

The Hollywoodization of world cinema is not in itself a new phenomenon. Already in the 1920s Hollywood had acquired 80 percent ofthe market in countries as far apart as west has never dropped below 50 per cent. But the market one and one in which there was considerable international circulation of non-American films. Also it was possible then for countries to close their markets selecing

alarming, in the current situation is that there are now no checks on the exercise of market power by the major Hollywood companies and the room for manœuvre for other cinemas has become severely restricted, even in the United States itself. Hollywoodization is now an accomplished fact; and the survival of other cinemas, except in Asia, has become a matter of complex symbiosis with the dominant power and the creation of small market niches. In many parts of the world the situation of national cinemas can be likened to that of the fish in the jaws of the shark. Meanwhile the monopolization of the international market means that many films, particularly from small countries, are pilot

Vhere does this leave the cinema? It can reasonably be bjected that seeing films on

however, cinema in the pure sense remains central to the experience of the moving image even in the sufficient market feature-length films. Although some films are 'madefor-TV' OI 'straight-to-video' can indeed be made electronically without recourse to celluloid, and although some films intended for the cinema never beyond the small screen, theatrical release in 35 mm. is still a necessity for most films of any importance. It is through theatrical release that films acquire their reputation and it is in the cinema that they are seen (and heard) as should be. Modern technology has made the cinema experience visually and aurally more powerful than ever before and it is this experience that continues to be treasured by audiences, even if their visits to the cinema are infrequent In the new symbiosis, the muchheralded advent of High Definition Television (HDTV) needs to be seen much more as an extension of the values of cinema to the world of home entertainment than as a further encroachment of television on the world of oftechnological development, the digitization of film images for transmission by computer links, will increase the range of crossovers between media point and standard against which moving images are assessed\_ for get they phase

In the new media symbiosis, the cinema is above all a showcase for the new and the spectacular (which in part accounts for the dominance of Hollywood on the big screen throughout the world) More and more the cultural, geographical, and historical variety ofworld cinema is reflected on the small screen rather than the large. At least in Europe and the United States, the number of old films available for theatricalor non-theatrical distribution has shrunk and the audience for big-screen presentation of films which are neither new, nor mainstream, nor specwhich are liable to be in POOr   physical condition) has shrunk too.

HOLLYWOOD OR 'HERITAGE'?

Hollywood has not only captured most of the screen space for major new releases (twenty of the twenty-six films showing at Kinepolis referred to above were American) it has done so with particular type of film. Gone are the when Hollywood was artificially restrained by the Production Code while European films were freer in their representation of sexuality and deviant moralities (European films may still be more honest in these areas, but that is another matter). Although Hollywood still makes handful of films for the shrinking 'family' audience, the vast andyoung adult audiences and are liberal, to say the least, This can no longer be interpreted as move towards realism; on the contrary (as Linda Williams points out above) it constitutes a new rhetoric by which films affirm their character as racy, exciting, and above as different from TV. Nor does this apparently transgressive rhetoric any longer have power to shock; since what seems like excess has become a routine selling element to which regular audiences (if not external observers) have become and the occasional grotesquerie, the new Hollywood films turn out to be quite conventional in their narrative forms and even in their moral values days all

Most of the vitality in American cinema is to be found on the fringes-in independent productions which may or may not be picked up for mainstream distribution. Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) draw on mixture of cinematic sources and deploy the rhetoric of violence with exceptional intelligence, playfulness, and wit. Tarantino, however; draws inspiration not only from the American B picture and its successors (Monte movies but also from the French New Wave; Pulp Fiction does to Godard what Godard himself did to the American crime status  is greater in Europe than in the United States\_ Gus Van Sant have also been able to force their way into world-wide distribution with refreshingly open-minded treatments of non-mainstream subjects (junkies in Drugstore  Cowboy; 1989; male street-hustlers in My Own Private Idaho; 1991), while Richard Linklater has boldly overturned Hollywood narrative convention as well as a fresh approach to his subject-matter in Slacker (1991) and Dazed and ConAmerican the United States itself is increasingly limited, depriving American audiences and future film-makers) of the sort taking

which has always been important to world cinema. The fact that American films now have all the street' credentials with young audiences and have firmly reasserted their status as emblems of modernity is sigAmerican cinema is still capable of innovation and of responding to changes in audience demand. But it poses problems for producers in other countries Should (indeed can they?) compete? Are there possibilities of fusion between Hollywood and non-Hollywood styles and production modes? Or must producers elsewhere retreat into other areas and trade on qualities that American films cannot reproduce? The most aggressive response has come from have developed distinctly Chinese form of spectacle which also draws on European experience (notably the 'spaghetti' Western) to outdo   Hollywood in the rep resentation of stylized violence\_ Meanwhile in Italy the tensions of modern as experienced by young people, are reflected in the work of the directorperformers known as the nuovi comici or New Comics , personality on television urgency in dealing with contemporary problems of there elsewhere in Europe: in cinéma beur and in the work work of the writing-directing team ofHanif Kureishi and Stephen Frears in Britain Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three White (1994), and Red (1994). they Hong poli-

All directors and pro ducers seem to have deserted the discontents of modern existence to seek refuge in the more comfortable world of the past. A new genre of film has been steadily emerging in the 1980s and 1990s, the 'Heritage movie'\_ In France and Britain in particular the cinema has turned increasingly to historical subjects and teenth-and early twentieth-century literature, from Émile Zola (Germinal, Claude Berri, 1995) to E. M. Forster (A Passage retrograde in this; where a rich past exists it is pity not to draw on it, and history and literature have long provided sources for films. Moreover films with historical subjects are not necessarily cocooned irretrievably in the past and can be used (for good or ill) to provide allegories for the present. But, taken in conjunction with a number of successful films which have contemporary settings but approach their subject in nostalgic and 'retro manner (for example A Fish Called Wanda (1988) or Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994)). the current crop of 'heritage films is evidence of worrying trend in European cinema. It is

not just that most of them have little critical edge and that they are content to replicate an image of a nice past whose occasional nastiness we can complacently claim to have outgrown More dangerous for the long-term future of European cinema is the temptation provide to retreat into a kind of upmarket Disneyfication of Europe as a celluloid theme park from which the discontents of modernity have been comfortably banished they

Meanwhile a serious ambiguity affects the recovery of the history of cinema itself: The richness of the cinematic past is widely recognized, but this recognition is reflected almost everywhere except at the boxoffice. Old films are on television and on video. are seen by growing numbers of students taking courses in film studies Alternatively are to be found embalmed in museum environment as monuments to a past state of culture with only scanty threads linking them to the present. This popular art. From the very beginning films have traded on newness. In the early days last year's-indeed last week's-films were almost routinely destroyed to make way for the next crop of releases\_ Now efforts of archivists but increasingly because of their potential continued earnings in secondary markets. But novelty remains the name of the game in the primary market of cinematic release, where all the publicity relatto films and the off-screen lives of the stars is centred The popular cinema has never developed 'repertory OI sense of tradition (including a need to rebel against tradition) in the way that other arts like music, painting, and theatre have done Even popular music is far more oriented to the recycling of a repertory (of songs or performance styles) than the cinema ever has been. To change this situation is certainly difficult, and will require a considerable effort of imagination on the part ofthe industry on the one side and the archives on the other. But in the changing media environment it is both possible and necessary. What have up to now seemed like straws in the wind-the occasional success of events like Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's restoration of Abel Gance's Napoléon ervation of the classics--need to be turned into more concerted programme of multimedia development which focuses attention simultaneously on film history and on its cinematic presentation. If the necessary effort is made the cinema can afford to face its second century with confidence. They they they for ing
